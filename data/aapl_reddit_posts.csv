NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since¬†[the launch of ChatGPT¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[¬†a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)¬†in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the¬†[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies ‚Äî Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),¬†[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) ‚Äî formed what would come to be known as the¬†[""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[¬†three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.

But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.

I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.

So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry‚Äîon days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.

The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.

What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot‚Äîinflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.

The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.

An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.

Could the exemption actually be bad for big tech,"Lutnick said today that the exemptions were done so that the exempted items could be included in the coming semiconductor tariffs (in the next month or two), and that the metric for this was so that those tariffs would not be negotiable because they are important for national security. And that this same situation applies to pharmaceuticals.

To me this sounds like he is saying everything not exempted (the stuff still tariffed at 145%) is negotiable, but semiconductors and pharmaceuticals won‚Äôt be negotiable when their new tariffs come.

Like the rest of the world I think Monday will be big green for AAPL, NVDA, etc.  and that the rising tide will probably lift all ships, but in the long run this actually sounds like really bad news for big tech.  There is practically no chance to manufacture those things in the US anytime soon or for a reasonable price and if these tariffs are truly non-negotiable these companies longer term outlook may be very bad.

I have long straddles on tech, pharma, airlines, and some defense btw, so I don‚Äôt really care if things go up or down just that things continue to swing.",2025-04-13 11:27:22,353,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jybkss/could_the_exemption_actually_be_bad_for_big_tech/,184,wallstreetbets

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

TSLA has been a terrible buy and hold,"From 1/4/2021 to 6/23/25 TSLA has gone up 43.34%

In the same time frame, MSFT (+123.25%), GOOGL (+91.39%), META (+159.74%), NFLX (139.75%), AAPL (+55.71%), S&P (+62.81%), and QQQ (+71.88%) have all outperformed. 

The only Mag 7 stock to not outperform TSLA has been AMZN (+30.84%).

What‚Äôs crazier still is that none of these numbers include dividends.

Also, as a side note: what‚Äôs even crazier still is that I looked at a forgotten about legacy company called General Electric. They are up a whopping 374.46% over the same time frame not including their dividend.

I would say the only redeeming quality of TSLA is that in this 4.5 year frame their PE ratio has dropped from ~1100 to 200. This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.

Also worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.

Lots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation. The only thing they can hope for now is to get EPS back growing positive instead of consistently negative Q/Q",2025-06-24 12:28:25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljhbcx/tsla_has_been_a_terrible_buy_and_hold/,62,stocks
Google: undervalued tech gem?,"I recently started a large (for me) individual position in Google. While I remain bearish on the market as a whole right now, wise investors have said value can always be found in the market. A lot of the market feels very richly valued right now, especially large tech. AAPL, MSFT, NVDA and Meta all carry PE valuations close to 30 at the low end and closer to 50. Google however sits under 20.



Google is a major player in data centers, which I believe will be a huge space in the future. Google also has a strong AI program as well as a very healthy ad program. They continue to grow top and bottom lines and in March had a 38% profit margin on 90 Billion of revenue. 



Yet it seems the market isn‚Äôt interested in Google. It is by far the worst performing Mag 7 this year, down about 13%. So with so many strong growth segments and a healthy valuation, where is the skepticism coming from?

Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

Which stock/index breakthrough opportunities have you been observing recently? Let's all discuss our ideas together \~",2025-06-23 08:47:17,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lih12j/opportunities_in_the_shortterm_market_volatility/,6,stocks

"Apple is resilient, but stock buybacks are diverting capital from its moat","As a longtime Apple customer, I deeply understand its value proposition. However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk. Management would be wise at this point to focus less on stock buybacks and more on effectively investing cash flow into more aggressive M&A and better R&D talent. I predict Apple stock will return 10% annually over the next 12 months. I also predict Apple will return 10% annually over the next 10 years as well.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

The stock price is currently in the vicinity of 193 U.S. dollars has important support, if broken may further test the 180 U.S. dollars line, and above the key resistance in the 214-216 U.S. dollars range, once recovered will be expected to regain the momentum of the rebound if the AAPL fell to 193-190 U.S. dollars range,

can be considered to take a small position in the low batch of buying, using the average support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If AAPL falls to $193-190, you can consider taking small positions to buy in low batches and take advantage of the SMA support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If the price can recover $205-206 and stabilize above it, it can open up space for a larger rally.",2025-06-17 18:46:26,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1le2m3m/apple_is_resilient_but_stock_buybacks_are/,71,stocks
Barclays: History suggests S&P 500 could mark turning point,"With the S&P 500 now trading at 22 times next-twelve-month earnings, Barclays analysts say ‚Äúvaluation alone may not be one‚Äù of the major headwinds facing equities.

‚ÄúSPX is back to 22x NTM EPS,‚Äù Barclays wrote, noting that ‚Äú30 years of history suggest that current levels could signal bear capitulation assuming EPS growth stays positive.‚Äù

Barclays examined three decades of forward returns across valuation bands and found that ‚Äúwhile average returns decreased (and the variance of those returns increased) as valuations rose from 10x to about 21x, returns actually improved modestly (and variance decreased) as NTM P/E crossed over 22x, up to about 24x.‚Äù

The analysts argued that this range ‚Äúhas typically traded at these levels for sustained periods in the aftermath of fast sell-offs and subsequent V-shaped recoveries (1998 and 2020 being prime examples),‚Äù adding that ‚Äú22x could be a good approximation of where bears capitulate and ‚Äôanimal spirits‚Äô fuel the chase for additional upside.‚Äù

Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, BGM, PANW, and FTNT could benefit if valuations remain elevated and earnings growth picks up, as Barclays notes.

They cautioned, however, that ‚Äúequities could be choppy over the near term as markets await clarity on US fiscal policy,‚Äù and that ‚Äú2Q25 earnings \[are\] likely to feature the first substantive hit from tariffs.‚Äù

Still, Barclays emphasized that ‚Äúwe see a limited case for valuation alone as an argument against further upside,‚Äù especially if ‚Äúearnings growth picks up to \~9% in 2026, as we expect,‚Äù they wrote.

Barclays concluded that while ‚Äúseveral pitfalls from fiscal to tariffs lay ahead for equities,‚Äù the market‚Äôs current valuation is not necessarily a ceiling.",2025-06-13 06:35:58,199,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ladnpi/barclays_history_suggests_sp_500_could_mark/,62,stocks

Taiwan Semiconductor‚Äôs May sales jump 39.6% as AI demand stays strong,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025. We reaffirm our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025,"" said Wei on the earnings call.",2025-06-10 16:15:17,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l8an4a/taiwan_semiconductors_may_sales_jump_396_as_ai/,11,stocks

[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn‚Äôt look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL‚Äôs recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.

Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.

[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum. Keep in mind that this is mainly ""C"" money + the hype of a recent C stock and IPO success of CRWV that has propelled this higher (it is a solid business model as well)\_. I think the momentum in this has deflated (we surged briefly off the open and then sold off for most of the day).

[**AAPL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-Intraday selloff yesterday came as excitement over the ‚ÄúLiquid Glass Design‚Äù underwhelmed, revealing more of a UI update than hardware innovation. WWDC tends to be a ""sell-the-news"" event.

"What To Expect in Markets This Week: June 9-13, 2025","No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224)

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's¬†annual Worldwide Developers Conference¬†opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing¬†artificial intelligence (AI)¬†market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a¬†healthy jobs report¬†Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500¬†back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as¬†Trump‚Äôs deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig, Beautiful‚Äù budget bill amid¬†increasing criticism¬†from Tesla CEO and¬†former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation‚Äôs Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday‚Äôs expected release of the¬†Consumer Price Index (CPI)¬†will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump‚Äôs tariffs¬†will be a key topic in Friday‚Äôs consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before¬†leveling out in May. Consumers are¬†consistently worried¬†that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market

GameStop‚Äôs (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which¬†fired up the meme stock craze¬†in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it¬†bought $500 million in bitcoin.

AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week.

China Trade Deal Next Monday - Could This Be a Game Changer for the Market?,"The agreement could bring clarity on tariffs, supply chains and maybe even some strategic partnerships With both countries under pressure to resolve ongoing trade tensions, the deal might ease investor concerns and restore some confidence in global trade  
  
Companies like AAPL NVDA and INTC could see movement due to trade implications. A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices

Chinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit 

 Even though we‚Äôre all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn‚Äôt address key issues like intellectual property or market access. In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected

I'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility

Anyone else planning to make moves based on this Are there any specific stocks you think will get a major bump if the deal is good",2025-06-06 14:34:24,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l51bzx/china_trade_deal_next_monday_could_this_be_a_game/,114,stocks
WWDC 2025 is next week  Can Apple finally deliver something real in AI?,"Apple‚Äôs big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* ‚Äî especially with the AI hype still going strong.

Last year, Apple teased us with ‚ÄúApple Intelligence,‚Äù their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn‚Äôt GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.

So what should we expect this year?

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

 iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro‚Äôs visionOS. Mark Gurman says it‚Äôs the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.

 AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don‚Äôt expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.

 Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.

 New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.

Also, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple‚Äôs been struggling for a few quarters now.

Bottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",2025-06-06 08:16:03,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l4s5f5/wwdc_2025_is_next_week_can_apple_finally_deliver/,15,stocks

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

"Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq trim losses as Trump threatens new tariffs on Apple and EU","U.S. stocks fell Friday and were on track to record a weekly loss as investors assessed the potential impact of President Trump's latest tariff threats and his massive tax bill on the deficit and economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports ‚Äúright up to 50 percent‚Äù as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",2025-05-23 14:44:52,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktsorm/dow_jones_sp_500_and_nasdaq_trim_losses_as_trump/,29,stocks
(05/23) Trump Comments Causing Market Volatility! - Interesting Stocks Today,"AAPL is the most interesting stock today.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-President Trump has threatened AAPL with a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., pressuring the company to shift production domestically. This announcement led to a 3.5% drop in Apple's stock and a broader market sell-off (followed shortly by his comments on Europe). Interested in a short if we break $193 at the open, otherwise more interested in the broad market ETFs. An iPhone made in the US is economically infeasible.

Provided FY26 guidance below consensus, projecting adjusted EPS of $6.20-$6.55 vs $6.87, and revenue of $12.0-$12.5B vs $12.8B exp. Overall they cited decreased US govt spending as the reason: they're 1/10 firms subject to a federal government ‚Äúconsultant spend review‚Äù by cancelling or renegotiating contracts.

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\-MSTR hit highs yesterday, driven by the underlying it's based on reaching an ATH. However, the stock and the underlying sold off mainly due to Trump comments. Pretty much moves with the underlying, currently trading at 1.74x multiple to the amount of C it holds. We're in a weird spot where the stock is ""historically"" at  a lower multiplier than usual but essentially near ATH.

[**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)\-SNOW reported adjusted EPS of $0.24 vs. $0.21 exp. Raised full-year product revenue guidance to $4.33B vs. $4.29B exp. Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B‚Äì$1.045B implies \~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the ""AI Consumer Hardware War"" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.

[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d)\-FHFA director William J. Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more ""economical"" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\-The stock has been on a monster run, and I'm interested in the short today. We've gone from \~$50 to \~$120 at the peak premarket, watching $100 level to see if we bounce off it or if we continue selling off. Most immediate risk I foresee is massive volatility; we're in speculation territory when it comes to this stock now.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-Reports suggest the insurer made covert payments to nursing homes to limit hospital transfers, aiming to reduce costs, raising concerns over care practices. I won't include the context because I'm sure all of you are sick to death (this is a joke) of hearing about it from Reddit. Broke the $300 level again to the downside, interested to see if this will dump in the open and may try to play a small bounce in this. I exited my main position yesterday (thank god), but looking for other places to enter.

I want to buy certain stocks and hold for 5+ years. Anyone have any recommendation to which 1 platform I should use?

"Smartphone exports from China to US plunge 72% in April, hitting lowest level since 2011 amid tariff tensions","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-smartphone-exports-us-plunge-073447213.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-smartphone-exports-us-plunge-073447213.html)

(Bloomberg) ‚Äî Chinese shipments of Apple Inc.‚Äôs (AAPL) iPhone and other mobile devices to the US dived to their lowest levels since 2011 in April, underscoring how the threat of US tariffs choked off the flow of big-ticket goods between the world‚Äôs two largest economies.

Smartphone exports slid 72% to just under $700 million last month, sharply outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the US, detailed customs data showed on Tuesday. That highlighted the way the Trump administration‚Äôs tariffs campaign ‚Äî peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods ‚Äî is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.

Investors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.‚Äôs artificial intelligence chips.

Last year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.

The value of phone component exports to India ‚Äî home to Apple‚Äôs biggest iPhone production base outside of China ‚Äî roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China‚Äôs General Administration of Customs.

Apple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",2025-05-20 05:51:20,457,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kr1v8c/smartphone_exports_from_china_to_us_plunge_72_in/,66,stocks

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Over the past 10 years, annual CEO pay increases have averaged 8.7%, while total annual returns to shareholders have averaged 10.9%","That stat is a finding from research firm Equilar, which calculated the highest-paid CEOs of 2024 for Barron's. 

The study found that CEO median pay rose 9.5% in 2024, less than in 2023 but more than inflation (2.9% in 2024) and average worker pay (3.8% in 2024). 

Stock awards made up about 73% of the CEOs‚Äô pay package on the list.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

I don't know how sustained today's move will be- we've made a massive move upwards, and even 30% tariffs will still reduce business with China by 70% in the medium term (\~6 to 9 month timeframe)

News: [Us And China Agree To Major Reductions In Tariffs For 90 Days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-and-china-agree-to-major-reductions-in-tariffs-for-90-days)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d) **/** [**AMZN (Amazon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d)\- Both stocks are up \~6% following announcement of a 90-day suspension of U.S.-China tariffs, reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)

[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&p=d)\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a ""most-favored-nation"" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to ""align"" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).

[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of ¬£57B against asset valuations of \~¬£120B. No levels I'm watching at this time.

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints,"Apple¬†reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company‚Äôs closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates. ¬†

Here‚Äôs how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March:¬†

* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG¬†

* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG¬†

* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount¬†

* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount ¬†

* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount¬†

* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount¬†

* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount¬†

* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount¬†

The company reported $1.65¬†per share on $24.78 billion¬†of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period.¬†

Apple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook‚Äôs first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration.¬†

Analysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales.¬†

Cook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of its products for other countries from China, Cook said. ¬†

‚ÄúIf you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúIf you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.‚Äù¬†

Cook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S. ¬†

‚ÄúWith an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,‚Äù he said. ¬†

Apple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase.¬†

‚ÄúWe continue to plan for annual dividend increases,‚Äù Cook said. ¬†

The company‚Äôs most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line‚Äôs sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis. ¬†

Apple‚Äôs profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google. ¬†

Cook, in a statement, hailed ‚Äúdouble-digit‚Äù Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple‚Äôs services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter. ¬†

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter.¬†

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March. ¬†

However, Apple‚Äôs wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates. ¬†

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple‚Äôs largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order ‚Äúpull forward‚Äù because of tariffs. ¬†

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no obvious evidence of it.‚Äù¬†

This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.

[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B‚Äì$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!

[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d)\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). 

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B‚Äì$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B‚Äì$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level. Heavy AI spending along with digital ad rebound trends pushed semis upward, they stated their sector focus remains on monetization of AI-driven engagement tools.

"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 erase slide to rise for 5th straight day in lead up to Big Tech earnings","Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

Big Week Ahead: Mag7 stocks report and important economic and jobs numbers due out,"Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Interesting Stocks Today (04/23) - Trump plans to be ""very nice"" to China!","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?,"I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.
Fundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or ""still a bull market"" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)

Some concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. 

So yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming ""anti USA"" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.

This is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. 

Here's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.



There's a school of thought that says ""markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable"" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will ""always"" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.
Another consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now.

"My 30+ Year Global Macro Portfolio ‚Äì Designed to Survive Pandemics, Crashes, Wars‚Ä¶ and Still Grow","Disclosure: This was formatted with ChatGPT, but the portfolio is real.

Hey everyone,

After years of bouncing between trends, missing some massive moves (energy in 2022, early AI), and learning from crashes like 2020 and 2022, I‚Äôve built what I hope is a **macro-resilient, globally balanced, thematic long-term portfolio**.

It‚Äôs designed to:

* Withstand **2020-style collapses**
* Endure **2022 inflation + rate shocks**
* Thrive in **AI, robotics, green energy, space, and aging population megacycles**
* Hold through decades ‚Äî **not just years**

Would love your takes, critiques, and improvements.

# What I‚Äôm Trying to Solve

I wanted something that:

* Doesn‚Äôt rely on me watching CNBC every day
* Doesn‚Äôt panic-sell when things get ugly
* Still captures long-term megatrends
* Feels like a **real system**, not a Reddit FOMO portfolio

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Am I *too* diversified?
* Should I consolidate some ETFs or lean harder into fewer themes?
* Am I missing any critical macro theme? (nuclear? private credit? Agri?)
* Would you trust this structure to grow for 30+ years with minimal maintenance?

"After surge to record highs, gold overtakes 'Magnificent 7' as the most crowded trade on Wall Street","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/after-surge-to-record-highs-gold-overtakes-magnificent-7-as-the-most-crowded-trade-on-wall-street-143338618.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/after-surge-to-record-highs-gold-overtakes-magnificent-7-as-the-most-crowded-trade-on-wall-street-143338618.html)

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html)¬†has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to¬†[favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html)¬†amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks ‚Äî Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),¬†[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) ‚Äî are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[¬†the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon ‚Äî the remainder of the Magnificent Seven ‚Äî are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as¬†[central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html)¬†last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold,¬†[upping their price forecasts¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",2025-04-16 10:40:54,452,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/,49,stocks
Netflix Stock Pops After Report Streaming Giant Aims To Double Revenue by 2030,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-pops-report-streaming-160434535.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-pops-report-streaming-160434535.html)

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday¬†after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion,¬†*The*¬†*Wall Street Journal*¬†reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030,¬†*The*¬†*Wall Street Journal*¬†reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a¬†[market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp)¬†of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap¬†above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A,¬†BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read¬†*Investopedia's*¬†live coverage of¬†[today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

The streaming giant has shown ""momentum‚Äù in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company‚Äôs overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

"Interesting Stocks Today (04/15) - China says ""No Boeing.""","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Back to the regularly scheduled programming.

News: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\- Trump is preparing an executive order to establish a U.S. strategic reserve of critical rare earth minerals and metals, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China, which has recently halted exports of seven rare earth elements to the U.S. in response to trade tensions. Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! 

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.

[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&p=d)\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.

"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Apr 11, 2025","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

This is a classic short squeeze pattern and I'm surprised no one is talking about it.,"It seems that very, very few people are seeing this for what it is:  A *market-scale* short squeeze.

1. The market was well on its way to entering bear country, and a lot of short positions are sure to follow, particularly with firms that stand to lose the most with tariffs, such as AAPL.
2. Trump posts that ""now is a great time to buy,"" prompting retail investors to flood the markets with purchase orders in advance of an expected announcement, driving up prices and making those with short positions nervous.
3. The announcement actually happens, prompting even more retail investors to buy any large cap stock that sounds reliable (despite having done no prior analysis or thinking).  This drives up prices even higher.
4. Short sellers begin exiting their positions and buying more, driving up prices on everything, including those that would be expected to continue losing amid the China tariffs, such as AAPL.
5. Boom, near-record ""gains"" market-wide, even on stocks that should still be losing, confusing everyone.
6. The next day, those who took long positions exit to capitalize on their gains, resulting in a return to fair market value.

This was a disaster for a lot of people.  Short sellers lost their collective asses yesterday.  It was still a massive loss for investors overall.

My opinion (not financial advice): I'd be selling any position I didn't enter for the long term and exiting this market until calmer seas prevail.  This president has no idea what effects his words have on markets, and is causing havoc that he's not even aware of.  He *thinks* yesterday was a huge win, but in actuality it was a bloodbath for a lot of people.

This was one of the biggest, if not THE biggest short squeeze in history.",2025-04-10 13:20:47,2275,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jw4uch/this_is_a_classic_short_squeeze_pattern_and_im/,314,stocks

China has retaliated.

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-China retaliates with an 84% tariff on US goods. The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.  

**Related Tickers:** AVGO, QCOM, SWKS (all iPhone part manufacturers)

[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&p=d)\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump‚Äôs tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the ""we are in danger"" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). 

[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d)\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70‚Äì$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures‚Äîtariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. 

[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&p=d)\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.

[**HUM (Humana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HUM&p=d), [**CVS (CVS Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CVS&p=d), [**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage payment rate increases for 2026. The unexpected increase in reimbursement rates is a huge tailwind for these providers, improving profit outlooks into 2026. We saw a spike in these health insurance names and subsequent selloff, interested in seeing if we make any sort of upward move today.

GENIUS stablecoin and potential push for tokenization,"/\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...

It is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.

It is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.

The grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.

Wait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.

So we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.

Too bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",2025-05-22 13:58:33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ksytv8/genius_stablecoin_and_potential_push_for/,1,investing

Have I bought too much MAG 7?,"I‚Äôm 20 and I‚Äôm from Australia. Pretty new to buying US stocks. However because of the market downturn I‚Äôve bought some MAG 7 companies that I believe in as follows:

AMZN - position: 5.6 - Avg price: 188.3 

NVDA - position: 3.9 - Avg price: 111.3

GOOG - position: 1.9 - Avg price: 161.9

AAPL - position: 0.46 - Avg price: 214.1

But now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôve invested too much into most of the MAG 7, instead of doing this I could have just put it into a SNP500 fund (I also invest in ETFs, have a good amount in VGS and VAS) 

The company I‚Äôm most bullish about is AMZN and recently been reading about GOOG being undervalued.

Any other business owners use market puts as business insurance?,"Hi, first post in this forum and just curious if anyone else does this. I own a lawn care company and a design build firm. Something that always keeps me up at night is a major recession/depression happening. I started dabbling in the market in college and then really started investing in COVID and all around really paying attention. Something I have had alot of success with and has really helped me sleep at night is PUTs. I have been nervous last couple years economy wise and for $10k to $30k a year or so in portfolio ""drag"" I can buy pretty phenomenal insurance just incase. For example, bought puts against SPY/SYF/STLA this last fall through Feb bc I was/am nervous and it worked out really well.

7 growth KPIs from Q1 earnings,"Just checked Q1 earnings and everyone's sleeping on these crazy metrics while freaking out about tariffs! Look at these KPIs (from¬†[valuesense.io](https://valuesense.io/)):

1. **$META**¬†\- 3.4B daily users and STILL accelerating growth! Half the planet using their apps daily. Insane.
2. **$MSFT**¬†\- $160B cloud revenue growing 20%+ despite the massive scale. Cloud dominance on another level.
3. **$SPOT**¬†\- 600M monthly users with 250M paying subscribers. Everyone said ""nobody pays for music"" but Spotify proved them wrong!
4. **$AAPL**¬†\- Services revenue hit $25B, now 25% of total revenue. The highest margin business nobody talks about.
5. **$RDDT**¬†\- DAUs exploded from flat 50M to over 100M with 30% growth. AI data goldmine hiding in plain sight.
6. **$ABNB**¬†\- Bookings doubled to $70B since 2021 while maintaining 13-14% take rate. Growing in every region.
7. **$MSTR**¬†\- Bitcoin holdings went from zero to $40B in 5 years. Say what you want about Saylor but that bet paid off BIG.",2025-05-05 03:29:18,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kf6jx2/7_growth_kpis_from_q1_earnings/,1,investing

IBKR Lite vs Robinhood trading data,"Please excuse me for being such a novice and redirect if this is not the right thread. I have some questions about trading data specifically in extended hours or overnight and live trading data generally. Based on a recent experience I had, IBKR lite is not the way to go if you are looking to trade outside of market hours **in a world where Robhinhood exists for free.\*\*** I did not realize that their data is not live overnight, nor is Apple stock data/Tickertech. Unfortunately I did not realize this and purchased AAPL at $188.xx, what it had ended at on Friday and said it was trading at on IBKR lite and Tickertech/Apple stocks. I happened to go over to Robinhood where I had deposited some funds to trade overnight and went to purchase another share of AAPL where I found it was trading at $178.xx. \*cringe\* Where does RH source their live data and where do I get more of this info if I want to move away from Robinhood in the future? Is overnight/after hours live trading data standardized (ie there's one source) or does it vary depending on the quality of the data? Ideally I'd like to get this for free. I understand that certain more complicated sources of live market data would have a cost associated. Thank you!

Can someone explain this for me?,"According to the internet and people that commented in my prior post, the market capitalisation of a company stays the same after buy back of shares i.e, the share price rises sharply to match the increase in EPS.

If that is the case, then it seems like a free way to earn money. Let‚Äôs say apple is buying back half of its outstanding shares with its free reserve. I have 100 shares of AAPL which I bought yesterday for 100 dollars totally(1$ per share). I sell 50 of those 100 shares and get 50$ as compensation and hold the remaining 50 shares.

Now, since there are only half the outstanding shares as before the EPS doubles. Since it has doubled, the price doubles too to match the PE ratio as before(Assuming the forecast of the company future cashflows with or without the free reserve stays the same). In such case, my remaining 50 shares are now worth 100$. Upon selling I finally have 150$ in my account.

Does the existence of such loophole mean, the EPS rising as a result of buybacks dont have a say in the future price of the stock and that market capitalisation decreases after stock buyback?",2025-04-03 04:55:59,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jqecr7/can_someone_explain_this_for_me/,12,investing

My questions are: 

1) In roughly 37 years and a conservative outlook, will I be able to live comfortably? I know there are a bunch of factors like location, future inflation, etc but just curious. Thinking of withdrawing 60-70k a year. Honestly I‚Äôm not even factoring SSI because I doubt it‚Äôll be a thing by then.

Advice for a single stock based portfolio,"I'm a dual US/EU citizen living in the EU. For tax and regulatory reasons, my options for buying ETFs are strictly limited, so while I would prefer to simply invest in a global index and live my life, unfortunately that option is not easily available to me.

With that being said, which single stocks (and how many) would you recommend for long-term growth, and in what allocation? I know I likely won't outperform an index fund but it's better than not investing at all. I'm in my mid-30s so I have some risk tolerance, and looking to build over time without checking day to day market movements. Generally stocks that do not distribute a dividend would be simpler for me, but I'm not sure that dividends can be entirely avoided in my situation. What would you do within these parameters? I'd be very curious to hear if anyone else has managed such a situation.

Some stocks on my shortlist include: BRK.B, AMZN, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, BLK, but I'm very open to hearing other suggestions or why these are a bad plan.

Self managed traditional IRA account with many small positions,"About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.

Would it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. 

I'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. 

For the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts.

The Traditional framework of Diversification is Broken,"The problem I have is how diversification occurs in practice.

If I were to tell you I have the following companies in my portfolio:

Social media, cloud infrastructure, e-commerce/cloud infrastructure, entertainment, electronic products, search

YouTube might review this portfolio and say:

2 infrastructure plays may add some concentration or ad revenue may be involved in 3 of those.

Other Than that, basically all different.

Problem is if I list the, like this:

META, MSFT, AMZN, NFLX, AAPL, GOOG everyone says your too concentrated.

I think portfolios would be better served looking at diversification on the basis of revenue and cash flow similarities compared to trading similarities. In the short term, trading correlations may make the portfolio move together, longer term cash flows and profits will drive the stock and diversification will come from diversifying those cash flows.

Competing Portfolios: In Office vs Remote,"How would you all think about investing in either of these competing portfolios? 

One is ""in office"" focused and has a bunch of corporate real estate and a few tech companies that have focused on being back in the office. The other has a bunch of remote darling stocks like zoom, asana, upwork and pelaton. 

# In-Office Productivity ([view strategy](https://double.finance/strategies/861))

Companies positioned to benefit from increased office attendance and a resurgence in traditional workplace dynamics.

* **Cushman & Wakefield (CWK)**: Global commercial real estate services firm that benefits from increased office leasing activity and demand for workspace solutions driven by stricter Return to Office (RTO) mandates.
* **Boston Properties (BXP)**: A commercial real estate developer focusing on high-quality office spaces.
* **Kimco Realty (KIM)**: A retail and mixed-use real estate investment trust (REIT) that could capitalize on renewed urban activity as workers return to offices.
* **Amazon (AMZN)**: Enforcing strict RTO mandates while leveraging its office footprint in major tech hubs.
* **AT&T (T)**: Driving RTO trends with its full-time office requirements for employees.
* **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)**: A financial giant mandating five-day office weeks to enhance collaboration.
* **IBM (IBM)**: Emphasizing in-office teamwork while offering enterprise solutions for hybrid setups.
* **CBRE Group (CBRE)**: A global leader in commercial real estate services benefiting from renewed leasing activity.
* **Apple (AAPL)**: Enforcing hybrid work while maintaining its innovative campus culture as a competitive advantage.

# Remote-Friendly Future ([view strategy](https://double.finance/strategies/863))

Companies capitalizing on remote work trends or mitigating the risks of rigid RTO mandates.

* **Salesforce (CRM)**: A key enabler of remote collaboration through its communication platform Slack.
* **Asana (ASAN)**: Project management tool built to support remote teams.
* **Upwork (UPWK)**: Supporting the growing freelance economy as employees seek flexible work arrangements.
* **DocuSign (DOCU)**: Facilitating remote workflows with digital signature solutions.
* **Airbnb (ABNB)**: Benefiting from remote workers embracing ""work-from-anywhere"" lifestyles.
* **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Offering hybrid-friendly tools like Teams and Azure cloud services.
* **Zoom Video Communications (ZM)**: Also included here for its role in supporting remote-first companies.
* **Meta Platforms (META)**: Maintaining hybrid flexibility while investing in virtual reality for remote collaboration.
* **Twilio (TWLO)**: Powering communication tools that enable remote customer support and collaboration.
* **Peloton Interactive (PTON)**: Catering to professionals balancing fitness with remote or hybrid work schedules.

Portfolio advice or thoughts,"I've been investing since the start of covid and after selling to pay for school I just started up again.  I'm looking for some advice and guidance on next steps.  Right now I'm on a Joint Tennant with a parent, that I need to get out of. My options seem to be, remove them with their permission from the account. Open an individual and transfer the money or a Roth IRA. My income, 29m is between 100-150k a year and I have a about 10k invested atm.

If I transfer the money to a Roth do I instantly hit the maximum? Is it worth it with my income, plus potential raises over the next 10+ years? 

I am also looking to consolidate my holdings for easier monthly purchases. My thoughts are to sell QQQM and NVDA to consolidate into VOO. However VOO is a bit hard to buy monthly due to price and how much I plan to put in, right now I'm averaging $200-500 deposits a month.

My holdings are AAPL, COST, DIS, GME, INTC, NVDA, RIVN, TSM, WM, AVUV, QQQM, SCHD, and VOO. I am leaning into ETFs and want to focus growth and divetends. If I up my monthly investments as I make more and become more financially stable I hope to get essiantls paid for by diventends sooner rather than later. I've also been looking into MSTY and JEPI...

Q4 EPS Discrepancies for Apple,"I want Apple's fourth quarter diluted EPS, but I am getting conflicting reports. 

Nasdaq and Trading Economics reports 1.64, while Yahoo Finance and my personal calculations get 0.97. 

To get 0.97, I subtract the 10-K annual earnings from the sum of quarters 1-3. Then I divide by the weighted average of the diluted shares outstanding reported in the 10-K.

Does anyone know what could cause this discrepancy? Perhaps 1.64 is using non-gaap earnings? Or a different time period considered for earnings?

I‚Äôve never been one to buy into the AI hype but Apple‚Äôs implementation simply can‚Äôt work with their commitment to privacy. From a tech perspective, I believe the looser the restrictions in the name of privacy, the better the results. Which is why Siri has always sucked. 

There‚Äôs only so much you can do with on-device models. Developing a pattern based on your data will help. It also helps advertisers. Again, in my opinion why Google is better at AI.

Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested¬†**‚Ç¨10 per week**¬†in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can‚Äôt remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn‚Äôt my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It‚Äôs not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of¬†**‚Ç¨520**¬†throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is¬†**‚Ç¨706.80**, which means a profit of¬†**‚Ç¨186.80**¬†(+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:**¬†Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:**¬†The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:**¬†I didn‚Äôt touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It‚Äôs just my experience‚Äînot right, not wrong‚Äîjust mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

Rate my portfolio - turnover advice,"I'd appreciate a feedback on my current portfolio. Here are the positions with the % size.

AAPL 2.3%
QQQ 11.4%
DELL 2.8%
IONQ 56.9%
IWQU (iShares World Maxi Quality factor sector neutral) 4.6%
LVMH 3.6%
NVDA 5.7%
SMH 2.1%
CASH 4.1%
Saving deposit (tracking 1Y TBill) 5.9%

All of this are at decent gains, except for DELL which is currently at a -27% loss and I am planning to cut it entirely. IONQ obviously has achieved an extreme gain and I am aware of the concentration risk. I have a price in mind at which I will trim some profit, but I am comfortable with the risk of seeing my portfolio volatility spiking up just because of that position.

In addition to the above holdings and outside of my trading account, I have another 10% in my banking account and I am saving for a mortgage deposit over the next year. Pension contribution is sorted out and my income and earning potential are decent enough to afford the investment risk of my portfolio. 

QQQ and IWQU are the two long term holdings that I am building; I plan to increase these two over time with further contributions and gains from other positions.

CASH is there for buying opportunities if the market dips at any point.

SAVING DEPOSIT might be invested or transferred to my bank account for the mortgage deposit.

I'd like to have your opinion for what I am planning to do with my holdings. I am thinking of the following alternatives:

- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split
- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. 

The reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.

I am looking at the evolution of the Semiconductors, hence why I am not touching SMH. I think that the sector has more room to run in 2025, but it will be the next one to liquidate and move to my two long term holdings.

Thanks!

P.S. let's take it for granted that I am an Internet person and by definition I am a liar and none of the above is true when it comes to gains etc.",2024-12-17 04:08:21,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hg7jft/rate_my_portfolio_turnover_advice/,6,investing
2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a¬†self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is¬†**73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).¬†**TL;DR:**

>‚Äú‚Ä¶AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn‚Äôt make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it‚Äôs the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what‚Äôs coming thanks to NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA (moat), among¬†[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).‚Äù

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",2024-12-16 08:08:16,841,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfjvh8/25_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/,184,investing
Investing in publicly-traded assets to benefit from AI automation,"What are the best strategies/channels to access investments that are hypothesized to benefit from advancements in AI and agentic workflow automation?

Are there funds focused on this? I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation. For example:

\-big white collar labor expenditures as a percentage of revenue and costs, indicating an outsized return on bottom line EBITDA from investing in AI automation

\-large audiences

\-large proprietary databases and content

\-large R&D budgets

\-defensible network effects. etc.

How can I easily and effectively invest to benefit from these kinds of hypotheses? For the sake of focus, fine to focus the conversation on publicly traded stocks and funds.

I know there are AI tools to analyze SEC filings, and I could build a list of hypotheses to evaluate, but this is a lot of work and others are better suited to do it than I (and I assume already have).

EDIT: I'm looking to identify companies that benefit from second order effects of AI rather than chip makers and LLM builders like META, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, NVDA.",2024-12-16 01:57:33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfea7v/investing_in_publiclytraded_assets_to_benefit/,2,investing
"COVID as a Mini ""Lost Decade""","By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future.

This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).

[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  
I've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.

**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.

**Red Arrow 2022:** A ""lost decade"" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. 

**Red & Orange**

[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)

If you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A ""lost decade"" is effectively exuberance that ""pulls forward"" price appreciation and ""steals"" it from future investors. 

In the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.

**Blue Line**

Long term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.

\---

The above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.

If you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like ""AAPL is a good company""

[https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p](https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p)

You have no perspective.

The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.

Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",2024-12-03 13:49:45,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/,0,investing
Old IRA very overweight in two equities - opinions please.,"I have an IRA from an old job that has grown to a balance of $700,000.  The ‚Äúissue‚Äù is $425,000 of this balance is made up of AAPL and MSFT.  I bought a decent amount of shares in this account years ago and didn‚Äôt touch them.  Got lucky basically.  I‚Äôve been considering selling the majority of the balance in these two stocks to move it to a SP500 fund (VOO).  I feel like I already know what the correct answer is but wanted to see some takes on this topic.  Thanks in advance for any responses.  

My concern is AAPL and MSFT will keep beating SP500 returns but there is a lot of risk in keeping these two positions.  I remember Enron, Worldcom, etc.

My investment portfolio hits 75% paper gain. Time to sell everything and run? ,"Been investing since April 2020 when Covid hit. Biggest paper gain so far from my current holding is from AAPL, NVDA, PLTR, CRWD and RKLB. 75% paper gain obviously is pretty good to me and it‚Äôs at all time high.

I told her i‚Äôd help her. She doesn‚Äôt like much risk in any areas of her life so i‚Äôm thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs (VOO, SCHD) or simply just the S&P 500.

"What's the take on AAPL's future given Trump victory, Tariffs and Elon gaining more power","What do you think will happen to AAPL?  
I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks?

"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that¬† diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

Selling weekly options on Friday,"After taking some big hits trading earnings, I‚Äôve been rethinking my strategy. I used to scalp and swing trade names like TSLA, but the stress and the potential for bag-holding after a fake dip isn‚Äôt worth it. Same with naked options, I‚Äôve blown up enough to know better.

What I‚Äôm considering now is¬†selling weekly ATM puts¬†on large-cap, stable names like MSFT, AAPL, META, etc. Not around earnings too, just clean weeks with no major events.

this is my rationale:

* You get¬†max premium selling ATM
* If assigned, I don‚Äôt mind holding the stock
* If not, I keep the premium and repeat
* And no gambling on earnings direction or IV crush timing

For example, sell a $480 MSFT put for \~$5.50 and you collect $550 if it closes flat or higher. If it drops a bit, I can roll or manage. Seems a lot more sane than trying to predict earnings or scalp all day.

Has anyone here run this kind of strategy consistently? How do you manage weeks where price hovers right at the strike near expiry? Do you close early? Any tickers or setups you avoid?

Would love to hear how others approach this style of trading. Looking for ways to build consistent, low-stress premium income without gambling every week.",2025-06-19 07:44:20,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1lf9vs8/selling_weekly_options_on_friday/,17,options
Do I Need to Close My AAPL Put Spread? or brokerage will take care of it?,"I sold AAPL put spread for June 13th, sold to open at 195 and buy to open at 190.

A low-risk AAPL backratio,"I opened the following AAPL backratio yesterday for $1.91 credit:

STO 14 AAPL $197.5 CALL 13 JUN 2025  
BTO 21 AAPL $200 CALL 13 JUN 2025

That was in the morning. The stock moved up and down, and as of close the credit for that trade was $1.26 (so nicely enough the position moved my way a bit). I plan to close or roll today. Now the interesting tidbit is, the risk profile considering the price at close ($1.26) is overly optimistic:

The blue curve is the risk at close (no surprise) and the violet curve is the anticipated risk today. That line is quite optimistic - the trade seems like it almost doesn't lose any money, and there's some upside on both sides of yesterday's close.

I know enough to not believe in fairy tales, so something's off about the curve. What am I missing?",2025-06-12 08:03:10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1l9lxdz/a_lowrisk_aapl_backratio/,5,options

I am starting to look in to put credit spreads on SPY and a lot of what I am reading or watching on youtube talk about opening positions 45 DTE and then closing around 21 DTE. I get that this is the optimal strategy to take advantage of theta, but when I look at the positions with around .25-.3 delta on the short put, the reward/risk ratio is usually something like 1/4 or 1/5. So if you only win about 75% of the time, you would come out negative. Am I missing something about this strategy?

Mastering the Wheel Strategy,"Have you always wanted to master the wheel strategy‚Äîturning it into a reliable income stream while also getting paid to potentially buy shares at a discount?

Too many traders segregate puts and calls into separate bets, only to fumble when the market surprises them. Thankfully, you can use the Wheel strategy instead to harness time decay, volatility swings, and assignment mechanics in your favor.
In this article, we‚Äôre doing more than outlining ‚Äúsell puts, then sell calls.‚Äù You‚Äôll get a full, five-stage deep dive: the theory behind why it works, real-world examples of successes and failures, step-by-step drills to lock in each skill, and advanced pro-tips that most retail traders overlook. Let‚Äôs roll.

##Why The Wheel Strategy Outperforms Stand-Alone Strategies

The Wheel strategy is a logical extension of covered calls married to cash-secured puts. Rather than hoping for a one-directional move, you systematically ‚Äúrent‚Äù your capital or shares to the market. First, you sell puts on a stock you‚Äôre comfortable owning; if assigned, you then sell calls to monetize holding the shares.

This rotation accomplishes two goals: you generate immediate income through time decay and implied volatility, and you avoid speculative directional risk by defining both entry (via puts) and exit (via calls) points in advance. Studies of covered-call indexes (like the BXM) show they tend to outperform buy-and-hold over decades in total return metrics, largely because they harvest option premium consistently. The Wheel simply adds the put-selling leg to capture premium even when you aren‚Äôt long shares yet.

Consider a long-only call strategy: you pay a debit and face total time decay‚Äîyour position can bleed to zero if you‚Äôre even one day late. A naked put sells premium to your buyer, but carries the risk of assignment if the stock gaps down. The Wheel blends them: premium buffers both directions, assignment always recoils back into another income leg, and your only true risk is carrying shares well below your discounted cost basis.

##Identify Ideal Market Regimes and Stock Characteristics

Not every environment or equity makes a good Wheel candidate. The optimal scenario combines moderate implied volatility (IV rank between 30‚Äì60%), a relatively stable price channel, and robust options liquidity. When IV is too low, premiums won‚Äôt justify the risk; when IV is too high, the market is signaling potential for violent moves that can blow out leveraged positions.

Range-bound markets are gold mines for the Wheel. You repeatedly sell puts near support and calls near resistance, harvesting premium each time price reverts. Historical backtests on range-bound stocks like large-cap consumer staples (e.g., KO, PG) or tech giants post-earnings (e.g., AAPL after major product cycles) show premium capture on both legs can exceed 12% annualized returns, even before dividends.

Crucially, you should exclude stocks with binary event risks. Stocks with week-to-week IV rank above 70% often trade in panic mode‚Äîassignment risk spikes, and rolling becomes expensive. Instead, focus on large-cap names with daily option volume north of 1,000 contracts across relevant strikes and expirations.

Deep-dive drill: Build a watchlist of 10 stocks. For each, note the current IV rank, 52-week trading range, and average daily option volume. Eliminate any that fail two of those three criteria.

##Preparation: Platform Setup, Cash Management, and Journal Templates

Before your first Wheel rotation, lay the groundwork. Choose a brokerage that offers advanced options analytics‚Äîthink real-time Greeks, custom chain filters, and reliable exercise/assignment notifications. Interactive Brokers, ThinkOrSwim, and Tastyworks all rank highly for pro-level tools and low commissions.

Next, manage your cash: since you‚Äôre selling cash-secured puts, you must reserve 100 √ó strike price per contract in available buying power. Treat that reserve as off-limits for stock purchases or other trades. This discipline prevents margin calls when assignments happen. If you run multiple concurrent Wheels, tally your total put obligations in a spreadsheet tab labeled ‚ÄúPut Reserves.‚Äù

Finally, create a rolling journal template. At minimum, each trade entry should capture: underlying, leg (put or call), strike, expiration, premium received, max loss, breakeven, and assignment date. Overlay a section where you log actual P/L and notes on execution quality or market surprises. Reviewing this journal monthly will spotlight which underlyings and strike/expiration combos yield the smoothest cycles.

Use a simple Google Sheet with data validation drop-downs for underlyings and strategy legs. Add conditional formatting to flag any max-loss >1.5% of account equity.

##Balance Theta Decay, Delta Probability, and IV Skew

a. Put leg strikes & expirations:
- Expiration: 30‚Äì45 days out. This DTE window offers optimal annualized theta decay (~3‚Äì4% daily on premium) while keeping rolling costs manageable if you need to extend. Weeklies burn too quickly; LEAPS tie up capital for months.
- Strike: 0.20‚Äì0.30 delta. That corresponds to a 70‚Äì80% probability of expiring worthless, balancing income with assignment likelihood.

b. Call leg strikes & expirations:
- Expiration: Mirror your put cycle or choose the next monthly expiration, whichever aligns best with your tax and capital plans.
- Strike: 0.30‚Äì0.40 delta. Higher delta calls yield more premium but increase the chance of early assignment; lower deltas pay less but may never get exercised.


##Precision Execution, Rolling Rules, and Assignment Management

Execution quality matters. Always use limit orders to capture your target premium. If the bid stays static for 15 minutes, consider improving your price by 1‚Äì2 cents to tee up a quicker fill.

Rolling rules: When a put is down 50% of its original premium with >7 days to expiry, rolling can lock profits and restart the cycle. For calls, if your call leg reaches 75% of max profit, buy to close and re-sell a new call further OTM or later DTE. These thresholds aren‚Äôt arbitrary‚Äîthey come from optimizing the expected value of auto-roll backtests across hundreds of historical cycles.

Upon put assignment, immediately sell your calls at or near the bid to capture fresh premium. If you miss the first day, you leave tens or hundreds of dollars on the table. Conversely, if a call is about to be assigned and you want to continue owning, buy back the call and roll to the next cycle rather than forfeiting shares.

**Tactical checklist:**

1. Pre-market: scan open puts at 2% away from your strikes.

2. Mid-day: if filled, set alerts for your new covered call leg.

3. Close: review any fills and log execution quality in your journal.

##Final Thoughts

By layering these five deep dives‚Äîstrategy rationale, market selection, preparation, strike/expiration science, and disciplined trade management‚Äîyou turn the Wheel strategy from a casual idea into a systematic income machine. Start with one contract on paper, nail down your drills, then scale up as your confidence and P/L track record grow. It‚Äôs time to make the Wheel work for you‚Äîlet‚Äôs get rolling!

Advice on CC / CSP on substantial-ish account,"Looking for some general advice on best ways to make income on shares of stock I already own. Info below

15,000+ shares AAPL Cost basis very low No interest in selling the shares

Current thoughts: Goal is to keep same shares so in CC/CSP scenario I would buy or sell back contracts if assigned to return to base share amount

Selling covered calls would work but if assigned I would end up paying tax on cost basis (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) before buying back so would effectively lose the tax hit and be able to buy less shares

Selling cash secured puts seems similar in terms of premiums and potential profit. More tax beneficial as if it gets assigned it would pull from margin and I could sell immediately without incurring the cost basis hit from covered calls (also correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)

In order to see any real income I would be selling large amounts of cash secured puts (or covered calls if I‚Äôm wrong on above) so I want to make sure I‚Äôm not being dumb or putting the shares at risk.

Also I‚Äôm fairly new to these type of strategies so if there are better alternatives let me know.

The Case for Gold's Rise and Apple's Fall - My Options Strategy,"**Looking to go long GDX & short AAPL ‚Äì here's my game plan (4-part position sizing):**

1Ô∏è‚É£¬†**First 1/4 on GDX calls**¬†‚Äì betting on gold miners  
2Ô∏è‚É£¬†**First 1/4 on AAPL puts**¬†‚Äì riding the bearish momentum

# Why GDX over GLD?

‚úî¬†**Gold demand**¬†‚Äì Classic hedge against inflation/chaos. If you think either‚Äôs rising, GDX wins.  
‚úî¬†**Industry consolidation**¬†‚Äì Big mergers (Newmont-Goldcorp, Barrick-Randgold) = stronger, leaner miners  
‚úî¬†**Market fear**¬†‚Äì When stocks tank, gold pumps. GDX benefits.

‚ùå¬†**China market shrinking**¬†‚Äì Losing ground to local brands (Huawei, Xiaomi). iPhone = AAPL‚Äôs cash cow. If it stumbles, so does Apple  
‚ùå¬†**Supply chain mess**¬†‚Äì Tariffs + India move = higher costs, lower quality (remember those defective India-made iPhones?).

**LAST MINUTE MONEY MOVE** Options Plays for AAPL Earnings and Beyond,"LAST MINUTE OPTION PLAYS FOR AAPL EARNINGS AND BEYOND

¬†

Continuing our eventful week of earnings and government reports, another great opportunity for investors comes from Apple. Personally, it is so difficult to tell which way the underlying will move, as Apple is one of the strongest and best companies in the world(heck just about everyone I know has at least some type of Apple product), but with economic uncertainty in the US and risk of costs drastically rising from tariffs, its impossible to know what will happen. That being said, we still came up with the best options strategies for whichever way it moves, and this could be the opportunity YOU have been looking for.

Our goals were to limit downside risk, maximize potential profits(duh), and be in the money as soon as possible, rather than finding a trade that is only profitable near expiration. On this note, for you bulls out there, the first trade we found is a 250/270 Call Spread, expiring in June

https://preview.redd.it/29lfp9wvd7ye1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ad8032fb1911455083281c0ba40d582843641e

The cost of this trade is slightly higher than average over the past two years, but well cheaper than it‚Äôs been over the past month and a half, which I believe gives it quite good value

https://preview.redd.it/opkhip3xd7ye1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00260cd72d206184bb86899e4b947069dbe2b8d

Similarly to many of the leading US equities, the cost of the underlying is high compared to the past couple years, but also well below its recent February high. The implications of this are for each investor to determine themselves, but there is a case to be made for movement in either direction.

https://preview.redd.it/itki5a9yd7ye1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5f7857e65314e158b8996c473f8592790150b5

The heatmap of this trade shows the profitability probabilities, and we like this trade because it profits immediately on a positive movement in the underlying, while limiting downside risk to the cost of the premium only, making it a safe trade with the chance for very strong returns.

On this flip side, for you bears out there looking to profit on a downward move, we found a 185/165 Put Spread, also expiring in June

The cost of this trade is similar top the positive one, in the sense that it is slightly higher than it was historically, but also cheaper than it‚Äôs been over the past few weeks.

https://preview.redd.it/0prq7ra2e7ye1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=6afa7f8ad836f4b9496ed81b2507c0885fa9682a

The heatmap of this trade shows the strong profitability of this trade, showing how it profits immediately upon a downward move of the underlying, while at the same showing how risk is limited to the cost of the premium, giving it a high return chance with minimal negative risk.

https://preview.redd.it/grhbdi85e7ye1.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9975e124b91f9fb972e1e03fc59a0eb58af04c6

In conclusion, this is a time of uncertainty in the US and global markets. This creates opportunities for investors to capitalize on volatility and make serious money. While I do not have a crystal ball and cannot say which direction AAPL or any stock will move, we can and do provide the best trades to make for each side and leave it up to you.

Buy shares and then sell covered calls during this market. Is that a bad idea?,"My idea is to spend something like $20-25k to buy 100 shares of a ""safe"" stock (like MAG7) and then sell covered call  1-2 months expiration, slightly OTM (if I buy NVDA at 111 I will sell the CC at 115), so I have a small profit if I get assigned. Potentially keep doing this as long as the market goes up and down. Of course I will buy it back when I am already doing nice profit, and sell it again if the market goes up.

I am looking for a good stock to do this. For now I have identified EBAY, AAPL and AMZN. Maybe also NEM or AXP.  What do you think? Do you have better alternatives?

Long dated leap options,"Yesterday during the dip I decided to go for the long term and bought intc 651DTE and aapl 288DTE. 

Of course given the current situation I think the value is going to fall further. However since it is a leap option and not short dated, should I be selling it to cut the losses (around 30% down) or holding onto it.

Option liquidity yesterday at around noon stopped for some less liquid assets,"At around lunch time (11:40ish around there) something in the options market happened. I trade options a lot and mostly scalp. Yesterday around that time i noticed the level 2 began to behave very weird and i experience a drying up of liquidity. All of the sudden it was harder than usual for me (cost more) to get into or out of trades.

Could it be that at that time big firms just decided to stop all trading and focused on clearing? Did MM just decided to play it safer and let it go until more stability is met. In 2020 i traded but not at all like now so these things are very noticeable for me now.

If anyone also experienced this or may have a theory about this let me know.

My favorite popular TradingView Indicators (That actually work),"I jusy backtested a few of the top indicators in Tradingview to see how they perform for options trading. Detailed results are in the google sheet bellow and my previous posts. Indicators:  *Alphatrend, Supertrend, Parabolic SAR, MACD, GD, Moving Average, ADX, Squeeze*

**Here‚Äôs what works best imo** (I use a paid indicator with all of these in 1, but here are decent free ones in Tradingview):

1. **Alphatrend**  [**https://www.tradingview.com/v/o50NYLAZ/**](https://www.tradingview.com/v/o50NYLAZ/)

* **Pros:** Conservative, slow to react, rarely gets caught in short-term overreactions
* **Cons:** very slow to react when there's change in the trend
* **Works best with**: NVDA (30min chart, credit spread), TSLA, AAPL (2h chart, credit spread), AMZN (1h chart, credit spread)

1. **ATR (Average True Range)** [**https://www.tradingview.com/v/cj3MJWNz/**](https://www.tradingview.com/v/cj3MJWNz/)

* **Pros:** Great for measuring volatility, helps determine contract sizing & stop loss placement
* **Cons:** can get into a bad trade, reacting to a volume spike, gets bitchy when there's no direction
* **Works best with**: GOOGL (1h, credit spread), NVDA, AMZN (30 min, 2h, credit spread)

1. **ADX (Average Directional Index)**

* **Pros:** Helps confirm trend strength, useful for filtering choppy markets
* **Cons:** slow to react
* **Works best with:** AMZN (30 min Credit/debit spread, NVDA (30 min, Long call/put)

1. **Parabolic SAR (PSAR) similar to GD** [**https://www.tradingview.com/v/MddD4giy/**](https://www.tradingview.com/v/MddD4giy/)

* **Pros:** something in between ATR and Alphatrend
* **Cons:** gets bitchy when there's no direction
* **Works best with**: NVDA (2h, credit/debit spread, 30 min Long Call/put), META (30 min, credit spread)

**Results/stats** for all Indicators: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uu1uxZQwsH8IrBg2x\_r\_4t9Bpll51bCJDZvK5oV3e7Q/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uu1uxZQwsH8IrBg2x_r_4t9Bpll51bCJDZvK5oV3e7Q/edit?usp=sharing)

   * **Profit Factor:** 3.80
   * **Win Ratio:** 54.55%
   * **Kelly Criterion:** 0.426

# What Actually Works?

* **Squeeze setups on AMZN and GOOGL**
* **Alphatrend Credit Spreads on NVDA, TSLA, and AAPL** have solid returns with high win rates.
* **SPY on a 1H Credit Spread setup** has the best win ratio, but the profit factor is weak.
* **MACD** is meh, worth mentioning only with AMZN puts on 1h and 2h tf  

Indicators are just tools. The real edge comes from risk management and actually having a plan

Can I Get Some Feedback on Options Strategy?,"I have been trading options for a few years now, and my goal for this year is to get better at portfolio and risk management. I have been decently successful, and I want to make sure I continue to gradually build my account size. I consistently use three strategies: 1) The Wheel, 2) Credit Spreads, 3) LEAPS. Does anyone have any advice on what proportion of my strategy should go towards each one? I personally really like Credit Spreads, but is this strategy ""riskier"" than The Wheel? Would it be wrong if my options strategy mostly consisted of credit spreads? What are people's thoughts on position sizes, stop loss, and underlying stock diversity? These are the questions I'm hoping to get answered.

Below is my proposed strategy:

1. Credit Spreads (50%): I usually trade approx 45 DTE with a 50% profit margin and 100% stop loss based on the premium value. I usually select a 0.20 delta for the short leg and 0.15 for the long leg. I usually do credit spreads on SPY, IWM, or QQQ.
2. The Wheel (35%): Standard wheel strategy on SPY or well-established companies (AAPL, GOOG, NVDA, etc.)
3. LEAPS (15%): I will occasionally buy LEAPS for well-established companies when they go on sale.

Let's say we have a portfolio of $100,000. How would you approach determining position sizes, how much of your capital should be used as buying power versus left as cash, and the number of unique stocks/ETFs to trade (is there a need to diversify or nah?).

Anyone successfully employ a dual PMCC/PMCP strategy using LEAPS on the same equity?,"Thinking of buying dual-sided LEAPS on a fairly stable ticker (AAPL, for example, knowing full well that NOTHING is safe in this current political climate) and selling 4-5 week options against both sides.  Using the AAPL example, a Jan2027 $200 call would run around $6300, while a put equally spaced from current price (say, $270) would cost $4350 (for a total of $10,650).  If I were to sell Mar7 '25 options spaced +-$10 from current, the premium collected would be (est) around $600-700.  Rinse/repeat monthly and the premiums would theoretically offset the basis in 18 months or so.  Theta decay on the underlying should be offset by the lengthy time to expiry, I would think, so it seems to be a fairly safe/stable way to generate monthly income at fairly low risk.  I doubt it's as simple as I've laid it out, so was hoping someone had some meaningful insight on whether this could actually work or I should go back to the drawing board.

Technical Indicators to Detect Short-Term Price Increases for Options Trading,"**Note: This is an updated version of a previous post that was removed as it wasn't sufficiently related to options trading; Mods, please let me know if this post is still not adequate**

Hello all!

I'm posting here again relating to technique I've started using which I'm hoping will be rather profitable in options trading. The technique I use relies on 3 technical indicators to predict short-term (12 - 24 hours post-signal) increases in the market; while the increases can vary considerably, you can consistently rely on a $1 - $2 jump in the price for most liquid stocks (that are above $100/share), which should be able to generate a profit a good chunk of the time.

# The Strategy

The technical indicators (and filters) I rely on are:

* **200 MA**: The price must be above the 200 MA
* **Stochastic RSI**: A built in indicator on tradingview where sub-20 indicates oversold conditions; two conditions must be met here
   * The indicator (K) must dip below 20 at some point
   * The difference between the fast (K) and the slow (D) must be greater than or equal to 5
* **The Ensemble Technical Indicator**¬†**(ETI)**: The ETI is an indicator I created (which is available on Tradingview) which converts numerous technical indicators into 1 or -1 (based on whether the trend is bullish or bearish for that specific indicator), sums these numbers up and then sums across the previous 20 value to generate a singular value. Here values under -40 indicate oversold while those over 50 indicate overbought. For more details relating to this indicator, you can refer to a post I made in the technical indicator subreddit¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalanalysis/comments/1fc1kln/the_ensemble_technical_indicator_a_new_technical/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The indicator must dip at or below -40 for this strategy.

So, to summarize, for a buy signal the price has to be¬†**above**¬†the 200 MA, with the Stochastic RSI¬†**dipping below**¬†20¬†**while**¬†the ETI is at-40 or below,¬†**and**¬†the difference between the K and D metrics of the Stochastic RSI must be¬†**5 or more**.

That's a mouthful! But it's quite easy to spot on a chart (I chose AMZN as I'm monitoring the chart right now), which I've pasted below. The candles are at the 4 hour level as this (and the 1D) level tends to have a higher success rate than lower timeframes (1 hr can also be used for more frequent signals)

[AMZN chart on Tradingview](https://preview.redd.it/h4xh4is7elde1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=54db642ff824c00f8145e77d8bb97f086667044b)

So we can see that on Monday November 25th at 9:30a, all our criteria have been satisfied:

* Price is above 200MA
* ETI is at/below -40 (-44)
* Stoch RSI has dipped below 20 while ETI is at/below -40
* The difference between the K (blue line) and D (orange line) is equal to or greater than 5 (6.59)

As such we would buy an ATM option at the next open ($201.90).

There can be some slightly ambiguous circumstances, which IMO fulfil the criteria I laid out, but are not as obvious. For instance, below we see the difference between the K & D is greater than 5, but the K is above 20. Again, the K simply has to dip below 20 while the ETI is at/below -40, so this in my mind is still a buy signal

https://preview.redd.it/sjv8clhuelde1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=276d1c9fa81689745eb5dc9489a31c10b97a7fb7

# Success Rate

What does the success rate look like using this strategy?¬†I ran a backtest using 4 hour candles from Tradingview, using the above parameters for SPY, NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, APPL & TSLA given these stocks tend to have the most liquid options. I also only included signals where the stock price (at its high) was at least $100.

Data went back as far as 2004 depending on the stock and when it crossed the $100 level (e.g. SPY) and a total of 175 instances were identified. When a buy signal was generated the average maximum dollar jump in the following three candles was $3.44 (vs. $2.62 when the above filters are not applied; a statistically significant difference).

In terms of thresholds, if you're looking to sell when the stock increases by $1 from the opening price of the candle following the buy signal, that occurs 69% of the time (vs. 62% of the time when the price is above $100 without the additional filters).

The results also vary by stock as seen in the table below. We can see that with the exception of AAPL and TSLA, the strategy is better than random chance at identifying at least $1 increases in the stock price in the 3 bars (12ish hours) from the buy signal.

|Ticker|Less than $1 Increase|$1 Increase or greater|% Strategy|% Chance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAPL|10|15|60%|72%|
|AMZN|2|23|92%|72%|
|GOOG|2|7|78%|67%|
|NVDA|1|6|86%|77%|
|SPY|29|46|61%|50%|

Now that I've explained the strategy, how does it work for option trading? when I see that a signal is about to be generated, I look to buy:

* ATM options with a delta of at least 0.4
* a DTE that allows me to make a profit with a $1 increase over 2 days.
* Once I hit my $1 increase I either sell, or set a stop-loss (acknowledging those don't always work) so I can further profit as the price goes up (remember the average increase is $3.44 with the median being $1.82 - meaning that 50% of max increases are above $1.82).
* If $1 increase doesn't hit I exit at the close of the 3rd bar (for the 4H candles; exit at the end of the 2nd bar for 1D candles)

I've already started using this strategy over the past 3 or 4 days using candles at the 4H and 1D level and have made a small profit winning 5/6 trades (the last one hit the $1 increase, but i wasn't fast enough to sell).

Issues with this strategy include that when you have to buy options at the bell, the volatility can mean you get less than favourable prices given how difficult it can be to time a good buy at the bell. Additionally, while this strategy at the 1D candle works 81% of the time (i.e. 81% of the time the price will increase at least $1 over 2 days) for stocks currently in the S&P 500, this is not much better than chance (78%).

I would look to hear people's feedback, thoughts, criticisms, etc.",2025-01-17 13:40:24,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1i3osjq/technical_indicators_to_detect_shortterm_price/,5,options
Help me with this one ,"Hey guys, another odd question for yall! 

In general I feel like I should be able to answer this myself, but here‚Äôs my confusion I guess‚Ä¶

My understanding of ‚Äúvolume‚Äù in general is just the amount of buyers or sellers. IE; when I‚Äôm watching my candles I see how much volume was in each. 

I understand open interest is the amount of OPEN contracts that people currently hold. 

So as you can see in the picture, you have OI on the left and volume on the right given a specific contract at the far left column 

If you have 207,553 open interest contracts, but the volume of those is only 84‚Ä¶ does that mean 84 have closed? Or does it mean that 84 ‚Äúpeople‚Äù have purchased between them 207,553 contracts? Just trying to find what the two mean together. 

NVDA $13 put Jan 17, has a volume of 0 but OI of 194,120 any help understand this would be appreciated, as I‚Äôm trying to use open interest along with verifying if it‚Äôs aligning with certain trends to implement in a trade plan.

Is a double diagonal with long deep ITM and short OTM the safest play to make with decent returns? ,"Take for example Apple (AAPL).

Exp 12/19/25 60C u/176.20 ; delta 99.8

Exp 12/19/25 320P @ 87.55 ; delta -100

Total cost: 263.75

Intrinsic value: 173.5+86.5 = 260

Extrinsic value = 3.75, or $375 per contract

Gamma, Theta, vega (immaterial in this case)

Max loss is capped at just the extrinsic value, which is at most \~1.5%.

Sell weekly 25-45\*delta options against it.

Exp 1/17/25 235C u/2.03 ;  delta 44.6

Exp 1/17/25 232.5P u/2.05 ; delta 40.6

total premium: 4.08, or 108.8% of extrinsic value.

Total money to set aside is 26,375 for the long options. For the short options, you are covered from your longs, but let's say 50% set aside to be safe: (235+232.5)/2 = 233.75 ; 233.75\*2\*100 / 2 = 23,375.

25375+23375 = $48,750

You are indifferent about the stock rising or falling as the deltas on the long options is 100 offsetting the rise in the price of the short options. If you get assigned, you can exit by closing your whole position. A weekly return of 408/48,750 = 0.83% which annually comes to 54%.

Accounting for the recovery of the long intrinsic value, annual returns are 107%, or in other words, a portfolio value increase from:

48,750 --> 101,195

Thoughts on this kind of approach?",2025-01-13 14:14:20,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1i0ne1c/is_a_double_diagonal_with_long_deep_itm_and_short/,41,options
"Went to a talk on trinomial trees in options (me, the gambler)","In their research, the authors employed the trinomial model to price European options by constructing a recombining tree where, at each node, the underlying asset could move up, down, or remain unchanged. This approach allowed them to generate unique relationships between risk-neutral and real-world parameters. By calibrating the model to empirical data, they developed implied parameter surfaces for select large-cap stocks, facilitating a comparison between historical parameter values and market expectations.
