$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.,"In no particular order:

- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.

- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.

- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.

- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.

- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.

- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango’s closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.

- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.

- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.

$50k in CLBR Calls,"https://preview.redd.it/kyijjvdg9x7f1.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=907bea8308e8e587646032ac419f9c6e6960f490

Alright regards, I'm back after mentally recovering from paper handing my TSLA puts on possibly the craziest timed DD ever right before Orange tragically dumped Enron (check out my profile if you wanna read through that clusterfuck). With help from my AI therapist, I've recovered and I've moved on to the next play.

Today's topic is CLBR: a right-wing SPAC merger taking GrabAGun public into the ticker PEW (think Star Wars like how those guns go pew pew, pretty dope) so grab a strong drink and sit down cuz we're gonna be comparing it to DJT and how CLBR is likely to mimic that merger but with extra regard strength.

**Status of CLBR merger:**  
CLBR just submitted their 3rd revision of the S-4 (form the SEC requires for mergers). I did a PDF comparison between the 2nd and 3rd revision. They didn't change much, mostly cosmetic stuff as well as some extra outlined risks the SEC probably asked for. The document looks pretty solid. Therefore, I believe it is extremely close to getting approved by the SEC. I estimate it could be as soon as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, definitely next week.

When the S-4 was approved in the DJT merger, DWAC (the sponsor company like how CLBR is the sponsor company for GrabAGun) jumped something like 14%. Not bad.

**What happens after S-4 approval?**  
The shareholders will schedule a date to vote on the merger (spoilers, they will vote yes). When this was announced in the DJT merger, stock fell like 7% ish. Then when the actual merge date was announced, it initially rose then fell something like 14% on the news.

If the same happens with CLBR this will likely be a great entry point for anyone that missed out on S-4 approval. I'm probably going to increase my position if this happens.

**What happens on merge date?**  
We all know what happened to DJT, it made a lot of lucky fucks very wealthy.

***The risk-reward here is just too good to pass up imo.***

**BONUS POINTS**  
That's right regards, I'm not done so grab another drink if you need it.

**Orange Jr.**  
He's directly involved in this merger. We all know how much that family loves to cause a good pump (and eventually dump).

**Financials**  
Unlike Truth Social at the time, GrabAGun is an actual profitable, positive cash flow company. That means that this merger is likely to benefit from both the **meme stock regards (us)** as well as **actual smart investors (not us/other people)**.

In other words, this merger is gonna have both **regard strength** and **fundamental strength**. I wish I could say the same about myself but unfortunately I'm only regard strength.

**Bank Policies**  
Banks are changing their policies with respect to getting involved with companies in the firearms business. And who caused this change? That's right, Mr. Orange Man himself.

Headline: ""Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know""

Pretty good timing for a company like GrabAGun, especially considering Orange's son (Orange Jr.) is directly involved. I wonder what else he could say to pump the shit out of this?

**Wartime and Political Uncertainty**  
What do people buy when they think WW3 is about to drop harder than a Drake album? Guns.

**Kelly Reisdorf Added to Board of Directors**  
She's the CEO of USA Shooting, I see future revenue streams opening up with this.

**What my AI Therapist has to say after I told it to do hella research:**  
""VI. Strategic Conclusion for the Sophisticated Investor

The public offerings of DJT, PEW, and NMAX signal the maturation of a distinct and challenging asset class: the politically-branded meme stock. These investment vehicles are defined less by their products or financial statements and more by a powerful narrative that transcends business fundamentals, a reliance on a central political figurehead, and a dedicated base of retail investors who view their participation as an ideological act.

For DJT, the narrative *is* the product; its valuation is a direct reflection of sentiment surrounding Donald Trump, with little to no underlying business to support it. For NMAX, a similar political narrative combined with a low-float IPO structure fueled a brief but spectacular speculative frenzy. The pending PEW merger represents the next evolution of this model. Here, the political narrative serves as a powerful marketing wrapper and valuation accelerant for what appears to be a tangible, profitable underlying business.

The crucial takeaway for the sophisticated investor is the necessity of a dual-track analysis. Traditional fundamental analysis—evaluating revenue, profitability, cash flow, and competitive positioning—remains essential for understanding the long-term viability of the enterprise. However, it is insufficient on its own. It must be paired with an equally rigorous analysis of the political narrative's strength, the loyalty of the retail investor base, and the technical factors, like share float and lock-up periods, that can drive short-term volatility.

The interplay, and often the direct conflict, between these two value drivers—fundamental reality and political narrative—will ultimately determine the stock's trajectory. Investing in these entities is not merely a bet on a company's success; it is a complex and high-risk wager on the direction, intensity, and durability of a political movement.""

**EDIT TO INCLUDE COMMENT:**  
Also worth mentioning: with this being firearms and Orange Jr.-related, there's bound to be some controversy. Especially if this gains traction. More news = more pump, especially if say Fox or NewsMax covers it and the rednecks start buying it up.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER

"Sunrun -35%, SolarEdge -30%, First Solar -16% as Senate Bill Cuts Green Incentives, EV Credit Ends Early","No paywall: [https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220](https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220)

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off. Tesla stock dipped 0.6% in premarket action.",2025-06-17 08:19:56,358,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ldmxys/sunrun_35_solaredge_30_first_solar_16_as_senate/,123,wallstreetbets

TSLA feels heavy  not your typical dip?,"TSLA dropped 5% today, almost 7% in two days. This doesn’t feel like the usual buy-the-dip setup

First, the subsidy threat is no longer just political noise. The Senate pushed forward a bill that could kill EV tax credits earlier than expected  that's about $1.2B off Tesla’s bottom line annually. Then Trump goes online and basically threatens to cut all federal funding across Musk’s businesses, including SpaceX

Second, demand in Europe looks weak. Sweden and Denmark just posted a sixth straight month of declining sales. Not great timing, since Q2 global deliveries come out tomorrow. Street is looking for an 11% YoY drop  if it’s worse, this thing probably flushes below $290

Also, I’m starting to think the “Musk distraction” angle is becoming more than just a meme. He’s on X talking politics, posting AI memes, calling out spending bills… while deliveries are slipping. Doesn’t inspire confidence, and the market’s starting to reflect that

Not short yet, not buying either. Waiting to see the delivery number. If it disappoints, I may play short into 270s. If it surprises to the upside, maybe there’s a bounce near 285–290

Anyone else shifting positioning here, or still seeing this as noise? Curious how you're factoring the subsidy risk into valuation now",2025-07-01 16:30:58,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lpe2v0/tsla_feels_heavy_not_your_typical_dip/,56,stocks
Why I am buying TSLA even though it will be unprofitable without EV credits,"The Senate passed Trump's Big Beautiful Bill today, which will eliminate EV credits.

Although EV credits only accounted for 3% of Tesla's revenue last quarter, it would have lost about $186M without them.  And that's exactly why I'm buying TSLA.

Because for the first time in years, TSLA will trade like what it truly is: a money-losing, high growth AI/robotics/robotaxis startup hiding inside a legacy car company.

Even if it 10x - conservative if you understand the TAM of robotics and robotaxis - it would put Tesla above $10 trillion in market cap.  That's bigger than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple combined.

For that reason alone, I am long short-dated TSLA calls.",2025-07-01 13:46:35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lp9v7j/why_i_am_buying_tsla_even_though_it_will_be/,38,stocks
"As a long term investor, how to strategize my exit plan (when to sell)?","I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don’t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? 

Let me give you several examples:

I was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.

Same thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.

SMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. 

I was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it’s overreaction) free fall. 

I bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. 

Lots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It’s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. 

Also, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there’s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? 

Market is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company’s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come. 

I need investing veterans to give me some guidances here? Appreciate it!!

Q2 Delivery Estimate: \~395,328 vehicles, down \~11% year-over-year

AI/Robotaxi Focus: Elon Musk’s shift toward autonomous “robotaxi” projects may be diverting attention from core production ramp

**EV Demand Softness:** Broader market data points to cooling demand in key regions (e.g. Europe down 28% YoY in May)

**Production vs. Delivery:** Despite production increases, delivery shortfalls could pressure margins and pricing power this quarter

Trump Announces Mineral Rights Deal With Congo What does this mean for the stock market?,"Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal 

This looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.

Brief summary

The U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar “minerals for security” agreement.

Trump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.

Why this deserves investor attention

KEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS 

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.

If the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.

Capital Flows Could Change 

If U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.

 Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities 

The Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.

Impact on Tech & EV Sectors 

OEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.

CURRENT MARKET REACTION: 

Global mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear

Market Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)

My recommendations from an investment perspective

Long-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.

Medium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.

Short-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.

Macro observation If the United States to “resource diplomacy” as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.

Some of my questions

Has anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?

Do you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a “paper peace”?

Bigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?",2025-06-27 12:04:50,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1llz7l5/trump_announces_mineral_rights_deal_with_congo/,35,stocks
"Trump: US-China Trade Framework ""Signed""  Rare Earths Deal, Tariffs Rollback in Motion","Trump just said that the U.S. and China “signed” a framework deal on tariffs and trade. This follows the informal understanding they reached in Geneva back in May

Key points:

China confirmed both sides have finalized details of the framework

China will resume rare earth exports to the U.S

In return, the U.S. will remove countermeasures (probably the steep retaliatory tariffs).

Commerce Secretary Lutnick says 10 more trade deals are close mentions Canada, Japan, etc

Treasury Sec. Bessent says they want to wrap up trade talks by Labor Day (Sept 1)

The July 9 tariff deadline might get pushed back if talks show “good faith.”

Trump already sealed a deal with the UK; the EU is next, but tensions are high (threats of 50% tariffs on EU goods )

Stephen Miran (White House economic adviser) also said we may not see tariffs go below 10% long-term, but some countries could get better rates depending on how talks go

My take: This could be bullish for sectors exposed to China or dependent on rare earths (think EVs, semis, clean energy). If tariffs ease, expect to see some relief rallies across the board

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [China Us Agree Details Of London Trade Framework Trade Agreement Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/china-us-agree-details-of-london-trade-framework-trade-agreement-beijing.html)

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\-Reported EPS of $0.14 vs. $0.13 expected; revenue of $11.1B vs. $10.72B expected. Despite the miss on earnings, the NKE CEO expressed cautious optimism, stating that while improvements are expected, a full recovery remains distant (mainly due to tariffs which he said would have a $1B impact). Also forecasted \~5% Q1 sales decline, a better outlook than the 7% drop forecasted. Interested in seeing if this breaks $70 today. Sportswear and LULU have been inconsistent in recovery from tariffs, interested to see if LULU moves (and has potentially recovery) from this.

[**OKLO (Oklo Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)\- Reportedly, the Trump administration is preparing executive actions to enhance energy infra and AI. The administration will release an ""AI Action Plan"" on July 23. These measures aim to address grid congestion, permitting delays, by declaring a national energy emergency. I'm seeing OKLO move off this but I'm interested other nuclear energy stocks as well. OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China. 

[**PONY (Pony AI)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PONY&p=d)/UBER- UBER is reportedly in talks to support Travis Kalanick’s acquisition of the US arm of Pony AI. A successful deal would reintroduce Kalanick to the self-driving space, and potentially integrate autonomous capabilities within Uber’s broader platform strategy.

TSLA down again EU sales drop 5 months straight,"TSLA sliding today, and it looks like Europe might be a big reason. That’s 5 months in a row of declining sales over there, even though overall EV demand in the region is still growing

Not great timing when we’re heading into Q2 delivery numbers  Wells Fargo already warned they expect a big miss. Market seems to be pricing that in early

I’m long TSLA but can’t ignore the red flags:

Brand perception in Europe is taking a hit

BYD pulling back production in China too  is it EV demand or just Tesla?

Still holding for now but feeling less confident about the near term

Anyone trimming positions or rotating out ahead of the Q2 report?

OpenAI’s Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

TSLA has been a terrible buy and hold,"From 1/4/2021 to 6/23/25 TSLA has gone up 43.34%

In the same time frame, MSFT (+123.25%), GOOGL (+91.39%), META (+159.74%), NFLX (139.75%), AAPL (+55.71%), S&P (+62.81%), and QQQ (+71.88%) have all outperformed. 

The only Mag 7 stock to not outperform TSLA has been AMZN (+30.84%).

What’s crazier still is that none of these numbers include dividends.

Also, as a side note: what’s even crazier still is that I looked at a forgotten about legacy company called General Electric. They are up a whopping 374.46% over the same time frame not including their dividend.

I would say the only redeeming quality of TSLA is that in this 4.5 year frame their PE ratio has dropped from ~1100 to 200. This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.

Also worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.

Lots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation. The only thing they can hope for now is to get EPS back growing positive instead of consistently negative Q/Q",2025-06-24 12:28:25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljhbcx/tsla_has_been_a_terrible_buy_and_hold/,62,stocks
(06/24) Second Day Movers- Interesting Stocks Today!,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mainly second-day movers from news yesterday.

News: [Iran Israel War Updates](https://apnews.com/live/iran-israel-war-updates-6-24-2025)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- NHTSA pressed Tesla for more information after robotaxi incidents caught on camera showed lane departures and speeding in Austin (this hasn't actually moved the stock but interesting to see how this ultimately plays out). TSLA surged massively yesterday (325->359) because of the robotaxi launch on Sunday, and streamers caught some traffic violations. Most obvious catalyst here is if regulators pull Robotaxi out of Austin, but I doubt that will happen. Also interseted to see if we move up for a second day. 

[**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)/[**XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XLE&p=d)\-President Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire he helped broker yesterday. We saw the market move up yesterday (and oil fall) due to Trump saying that the Israel and Iran conflict was set to end in a ceasefire. This may be a telegraphed move to say that the ceasefire might not hold. If so then we may see a surge in oil if the conflict continues and the market fall. Overall I'm mainly interested in the moves of oil because this actually hasn't budged VIX too much. 

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Crypto “rules of the road” framework unveiled by Senators. The bipartisan GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68–30 to regulate stableCs. CRCL moved up to $299 yesterday and then sell off after a MASSIVE move since the IPO- I think that the selloff from the move was saved primarily due to Trump's announcement of the Iran/Israel ceasefire (which caused the entire market to move up). We might see another selloff today- still short biased in this and not interested in this long. 

Random risks I'm thinking of that could kill momentum: The bill now has to pass the House; dilution by the STABLE Act could change issuer oversight, and international competition (Tether) could beat this in the longrun. 

[**NTRS (Northern Trust Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NTRS&p=d)\-Northern Trust shares surged Friday \~8% after reports that Bank of New York Mellon approached the company about a potential merger. Overall wasn't an extremely interesting catalyst but NTRS said they're committed to remaining independent, so we may see additional updates on this. (Most companies that are committed to remaining independent are holding out for a higher buyout price).

"Tesla & Google heat up the Robotaxi race  TSLA pops, GOOGL lags","Big moves in the robotaxi world this week.

TSLA just launched its robotaxi service in Austin, TX over the weekend, and the market loved it. The stock ripped +8% on Monday and kept the momentum into Tuesday, pushing up another 2% premarket

Meanwhile, Alphabet’s Waymo (backed by $GOOGL) responded fast announcing its own robotaxi expansion into Atlanta through its Uber partnership. Waymo now runs in LA, Austin, Phoenix, SF, and soon Miami & DC. Solid coverage

What’s surprising though: $GOOGL only got a modest bump (\~1%) while $TSLA surged

Robotaxi = massive long-term play. Whoever wins autonomy could dominate transportation over the next decade

Personally, I’m a bit surprised by the muted reaction on GOOGL. Waymo’s rollout is arguably more polished  it’s already operating in multiple cities and has a real partnership with Uber. But the market still gives the hype crown to Tesla.

GOOGL, on the other hand, feels like it’s building the future… quietly. Maybe too quietly

Still, I wouldn’t count Waymo out. If it scales smoothly with Uber, the upside could sneak up on people",2025-06-24 08:01:35,276,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljaik7/tesla_google_heat_up_the_robotaxi_race_tsla_pops/,324,stocks
Tesla Robotaxi goes live  stock rockets TSLA will continue to rise   or is it going cold?,"Fellow TSLA observers, checking in  As you may have seen  Tesla made big news recently: self-driving cabs (Robotaxi) officially went live in Austin charging only $4.20 per order (yup  Musk is playing the game again) 

On June 23rd, Tesla launched a trial run of Robotaxi in Austin  Texas Pricing is $4.20 per order  and it still has a human safety officer sitting in the car  but it has already begun to pay for external operations News As soon as the news came out Tesla stock spiked 8-10% straight up in pre-market to close near $348-$350 for the day 

Is TSLA up or down?

So far: TSLA is still running high  shares around $349. 8%+ one-day spike after Robotaxi

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

Anyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in? Or are you ready to dump at $360?",2025-06-23 15:26:46,193,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lirftv/tesla_robotaxi_goes_live_stock_rockets_tsla_will/,313,stocks
Notorious doomsayer back here again,"**Long term opinion:** I am of the opinion that anytime P/E ratios hit more than 20 for S & P 500, I know the long term returns start going down and with P/E close to 22 to 23.

**Positions:** I am sitting on 90% cash and using my 10% for day trading - Recent profits were all on INTC and TSLA. I always close EOD. I bought FSENX for 5% of my funds

**Thought:** I like looking at indirect impact points in addition to traditional technicals. Example - I keep an eye on are on Fedex/UPS earnings calls for retail forecasts (shipping volume directly proportional to sales numbers), banking earnings for understanding liquidity, credit availability, and investment returns etc. and not wait for formal readings like CPI etc to post.

**Target:** I have a SPY target of 550 to 600 for July 2026.

**Discussion points:**

* **Inflation** has not hit the economy yet, but this weeks earnings will start showing hints of it.
* Inflation if not controlled can impact **liquidity** (can impact 401k contributions, DCA contributions etc...)
* **War is never cheap** and thought it can give short term bursts of boosts to stock markets with rumors.
* **Debt** is good until it is within means - i.e. Debt < GDP
* **Risk fatigue is real** \- Your month on month contributions are being blindly invested in those target funds without risk readings taken into considerations and rug pulls are not uncommon.
* **AI bubble** is similar to the dot com bubble - those who know it, know it that dot com investments went beyond the realistic capabilities that were not realized until 10-15 years down the line but by then the bubble burst and took 10-12 years to recover.

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off.

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

TSLA Shares Rebound as Musk Steps Back from Trump Clash,"So Elon Musk just backed off from his beef with Trump, saying on X that some of his posts went “too far” and he regrets them That’s a pretty big shift after all the drama. Trump, meanwhile, isn’t interested in making up and warned Musk he could face “serious consequences” if he helps Democrats

This whole feud has Wall Street on edge, especially Tesla investors. Tesla’s rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin is supposed to kick off June 22 but there’s worry Trump might use federal regulators to slow things down kind of a political roadblock that could hit Tesla’s growth hard

Tesla shares bounced back almost 2% early Wednesday, recovering some of last week’s losses when the Musk-Trump drama blew up

From an investor’s perspective  how do you see this playing out? Does Musk’s “sorry” move calm the waters enough to keep Tesla on track? Or is the political heat going to keep putting a ceiling on Tesla’s potential?",2025-06-11 11:36:02,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l8xc08/tsla_shares_rebound_as_musk_steps_back_from_trump/,35,stocks

News: [Us China Officials Say Consensus Reached On Geneva Framework](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/us-china-officials-say-consensus-reached-on-geneva-framework?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-More easing in Trump/Musk tensions, both have tweeted reconciliatory tweets earlier this morning and it seems their feud is at an end. Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.

[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.

Will robots be the next smartphone?,"Tesla appears to be undervalued given its potential to revolutionize the field of robotics for both business and personal use. Stock prices on Wall Street are based on expectations for the future; we must consider what the robotics world will soon look like.Robots have become an integral part of the automotive and semiconductor industries, but mass-produced autonomous robots could have a significant impact on society and Tesla stock.Despite personal concerns, the arrival of advanced robots seems inevitable and it is worth considering future investment opportunities. 

Will Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) robots be the next smartphone device for the mass market? Will they have the same impact on society as smartphones? In this article, we'll look at the robots Tesla is developing and whether we can profit from this potential shift.

To some extent, Wall Street bases its judgment on future profit expectations for stock prices. When we think about future prospects, we have to think about what the world will look like in 3, 5, or 10 years and what will happen to stock prices? This is obviously a very difficult question to answer, but we can make reasonable predictions about the overall growth of the emerging humanoid robotics industry.

Ignoring the risks posed by AI and robots to the survival of the species, we can probably assume that the short-term risk is that China will continue to dominate Chinese EV sales, and that Tesla could face a very tough time in the Chinese market. However, global sales of electric vehicles continue to grow. However, as EVs continue to grow, Tesla will need something to differentiate itself, and that's where self-driving cars might come into play. I guess we'll see if that will fully materialize, and for now, it looks like advanced testing will take place in Austin, Texas. Let's move on to the next issue.

China has a monopoly on rare earth elements used in Tesla robots and electric cars. The U.S. government needs to break that monopoly by heavily funding domestic resources. According to Reuters, President Trump may be on the verge of passing the Defense Production Act to fund critical and rare earth elements. Of course, we are currently in the midst of various political waves that are clashing between Elon and President Trump. Trying to predict what will happen between the two of them is futile as they are both unknowns, but it's just something to be aware of. Another risk factor is that Tesla currently has a lot of production in China. If relations with the U.S. deteriorate further, there could be repercussions. That's an unknown to keep an eye on.

I think Tesla Robotics as well as solutions from NVIDIA, Amazon and China are on their way and will materialize in the next few years. Regarding the potential market size, according to a Reuters article, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said, The age of robotics has arrived. People are paying attention. This is likely to be the biggest industry.



So will humanoid robots become as popular as smartphones? I think it's possible, and if we look at how Elon is transforming Optimus Prime in the factory, we'll have a clearer picture of the future in a few years.",2025-06-10 09:45:48,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l80l6z/will_robots_be_the_next_smartphone/,21,stocks

[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn’t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL’s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.

Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.

[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum. Keep in mind that this is mainly ""C"" money + the hype of a recent C stock and IPO success of CRWV that has propelled this higher (it is a solid business model as well)\_. I think the momentum in this has deflated (we surged briefly off the open and then sold off for most of the day).

[**AAPL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-Intraday selloff yesterday came as excitement over the “Liquid Glass Design” underwhelmed, revealing more of a UI update than hardware innovation. WWDC tends to be a ""sell-the-news"" event.

"25M Learnig finances, is my plan any good for a 5 or 10 years?","I'm currently building a long-term investment portfolio with around $15,500 in USD. My approach is to combine strong exposure to tech and innovation with some international diversification. I've selected individual stocks like NVIDIA(15%) and AMD(10%) to capture growth in the AI and semiconductor space, and I've included TSLA(10%) as a way to gain exposure to the EV and energy transition sectors—though I'm open to switching that position for aerospace and defense in the future, depending on market conditions.

To complement those, I'm using the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (15%) for broader exposure to leading U.S. tech companies. I've also added the Franklin FTSE India ETF (10%) to capture long-term growth potential in emerging markets, particularly India. In addition, I've chosen a cybersecurity ETF (RIZE CYBR) (10%) to position myself in a sector that's increasingly critical, and I’ve added a biotech ETF along with Moderna(15%)to diversify into healthcare innovation.

Besides this USD portfolio, I hold 10,000 euros in the Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund. I plan to add 75 euros monthly to this fund, while saving another 75 euros each month as cash on the side, to take advantage of opportunities within my main portfolio or strengthen existing positions when there are dips.

Lastly, I’m keeping around 35,000 euros in cash, which I plan to hold in a high-interest savings account or similar low-risk vehicle, with full liquidity in case I decide to make a property purchase in the near future.

This mix allows me to stay invested in sectors I believe in, while maintaining flexibility and liquidity for both opportunities and personal needs. Open to thoughts or suggestions on how to improve it.

\*Edit: 

My current main questions:

1. Can all this markets go up during 4 and a half years but suddenly on the 5th year go down? What's the point then holding long term? 

2. The longer you hold, the less a ""break down"" can affect your portfolio? For example: A general 40% down will make you lose money on year 5 but you will be ""strong enough"" at year 10 to still being positive eventhough the breakdown? 

3. I know ""time in the market > timing in the market"" but do you think it is a good week/month to enter? Nvidia for example is super high right now. 

4. If you hold for 10 years, but there's a big loss on year 10. Does that mean all those 9 years have been useless and you gotta start again?

"What To Expect in Markets This Week: June 9-13, 2025","No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224)

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market

GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.

AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.

My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16),"***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.

We all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.

This wasn’t a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.

On June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.

**Entry Zone:**  
$285–$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.

**Target Zone:**  
$305–$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.

**Danger Zone:**  
Avoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.

Now looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):

CRWV IPO’d in March and ran from \~$57 (May 13) to \~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That’s a classic parabolic extension.

It pulled back on June 5 to \~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.

Options flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150–$160, but we’re also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.

**Entry Zone:**  
Watching $130–$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.

**Target Zone:**  
$155–$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.

**Danger Zone:**  
A breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114–$118 as the next volume shelf.

**Conclusion:**  
TSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.

Would love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you’re tracking the same flows or setups.

This is a disaster of epic proportion”  Trump vs. Musk turns into a $150B Tesla bloodbath,"Anyone else watching this Trump vs Musk drama and thinking... wtf is Elon doing?

Tesla just dropped 14% in one day  wiped out $150B in market cap  after Musk started trashing Trump’s new spending bill on X. Called it “disgusting” and “pork-filled.” Trump clapped back, then Elon basically said Trump wouldn’t have even won the election without him

Now everyone’s freaking out. Investors like Ross Gerber are calling it a “disaster,” saying Elon made this mess by getting political in the first place. And let’s be real killing EV tax credits would be a huge blow to Tesla

TSLA bounced a bit on Friday (+3.7%) but it’s still way down from earlier this week. Morgan Stanley is still bullish (lol), $410 price target and all that

But man… Elon used to be the hype. Now he’s beefing with a sitting president, and Tesla’s stock is paying the price",2025-06-06 18:18:49,4922,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l56hgo/this_is_a_disaster_of_epic_proportion_trump_vs/,714,stocks

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.

[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break.

Tesla stock falls again as Musk's 'KILL the BILL' screed hits Trump tax bill's progress,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html)

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",2025-06-05 08:01:00,1296,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l3yldf/tesla_stock_falls_again_as_musks_kill_the_bill/,193,stocks
FSLR Call Option Program - Bullish on Solar Sector Explosion!,"I got into TSLA before the market, and it came off smoothly at $351, and by the way, I also liquidated my position in CRWV. although CRWV averaged $100 and sold at $148, making a small profit, I missed out on the back of the market that spiked up to $155. We can't be greedy though, profit is profit!

(05/29) Tariffs and Teslas and Takeovers!,"NVDA is the most interesting stock today.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump's Trade Strategy Upended After Court Blocks Global Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-29/trump-s-trade-strategy-upended-after-court-blocks-global-tariffs)

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp. The company said that guidance would have been $8B higher except for lost sales from the China restriction on H20 chips. I was mainly interested in the $140 level yesterday and we blew past that afterhours yesterday. Overall, great earnings report with further hopes that China restriction is lifted. Not too interested in  Keep in mind that ATH is \~$152.

[**ELF (e.l.f. Beauty)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ELF&p=d)\-ELF announced the acquisition of Hailey Bieber's skincare brand, Rhode, in a deal valued up to $1B. The transaction is $600M cash/$200M in stock, and potential $200M earnout based on Rhode's growth over the next three years. This ended up reversing ELF's earnings report yesterday (which was negative due to the thread of tariffs), and signaled that ELF is moving into skincare. We've made a pretty huge move up to $105.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, utilizing driverless Model Y vehicles. Elon Musk also confirmed he is leaving the government DOGE initiative and will focus on the company. This has been on a tear for the past month- that break from the $300 level was what I was most interested in, interested if we set up again for $375/$400. The launch of its robotaxi service is another way to signal that it's challenging Waymo, but whether it will succeed without LIDAR or not is another question. Regulation news/catalysts are the biggest potential movers of the robotaxis news.",2025-05-29 08:15:28,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kyaiiu/0529_tariffs_and_teslas_and_takeovers/,1,stocks
Elon Musk just dunked on Trump’s $3T “Big Beautiful Bill”  and now tech bros are turning,"In a CBS interview, Elon said he’s *“disappointed”* with the bill    calling it a deficit disaster that undermines his DOGE team's mission to cut $2T in spending

Chamath and Calacanis (yeah, those All-In guys) shredded the bill too. One called it “deep state candyland”

Even TSLA own boss is saying: *“A bill can be big or beautiful... but not both*

Meanwhile, NVDA and other high flyers are riding the AI wave, but this kind of political chaos could spook markets  especially if Musk keeps stepping away from DC and focusing back on Tesla

If Musk continues to pull away from Washington politics and DOGE, could we see a renewed focus on Tesla's core business and earnings? Or will the policy chaos spook institutional buyers?

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Bottom line: If you’re betting on wild future tech, TSLA might be your pick. But if you care about solid execution, real revenue, and smart expansion  I’m rolling with BYDDY",2025-05-25 15:53:00,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kvcs9x/tsla_vs_byddy_which_ev_stock_is_the_better_bet/,131,stocks
Elon says he's back to work 24/7; bullish on TSLA,"So obviously after Elon hurt his reputation/brand after extremely unpopular political activities, it took a major outage at X dot com to result in this:

> “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” Musk wrote in a post on X on Saturday replying to news of outages on the platform. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

For me this is extremely bullish as his involvement with TSLA was the main driver for its success & stock price. 

Having Elon back to work at Tesla is going to get those products out the door, especially robi taxi & those dancing robots.. I know it sounds comical but I see 100s of millions of people buying these robots.

**Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week**

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy. ",2025-05-25 08:16:24,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,3,stocks
Why Shorting Never Works,"Once upon a time the market attempted to price stocks for what they would be worth in the future. Buying and selling decisions were made based on fundamentals and forward guidance. Over time we have drifted from this concept, and become the market we have today. Debt, earnings, current revenue - these things do not matter. Bond yields at nosebleed levels? Who cares. All that matters is the potential for a revenue increase at an unknown date in the future. Look at quantum stocks, they are wildly overvalued by standard metrics. But they continue to fly higher. Why? Because at some point in the next 10-20 years they will earn more revenue than they do today. 

Look at CRWV, burning cash but promises to have future revenue (because companies who need ai compute capacity will never build out their own capacity right?), so it will continue to go up in a straight line. Likely for months or years, maybe forever. 

Look at TSLA. Huge future revenue promises for robotics and self driving. Maybe even ai too. Doesn’t matter if none of it happens, the stock will continue to move higher. 

Huge debt risks for the US? Downgrade and terrible 20 year bond auction showing risks of something very terrible coming? Doesn’t matter, indexes will always go up, there will be no dip that matters. It will always v up. The market IS different now. Debt will continue to grow and the globe will continue to support the US. If things get dire the government will just offer mild tariff relief if other countries agree to buy up massive amounts of US bonds and treasuries. The system will never fail, stop betting that it will.

The moral of the story here is simple, shorting never works. Period. Stocks that go down will go up more in the future. Because everyone believes that buying the dip works, it works. And it always will. This is likely very annoying for a lot of people who think valuations are high etc. If you are one of those people just give up. This time IS different. The globe has been conditioned to buy the dip. It will never stop. So join the herd or get run over by it.

Tesla's New Self-Driving Ride-Hailing Service – A Game Changer?,"Hey everyone – just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into ""questionable diagnoses"" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.

Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.

Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs). Watching $125 level. Alibaba's cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

News: [Deepseek Races After Chatgpt As China's AI Industry Soars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/deepseek-races-after-chatgpt-as-china-s-ai-industry-soars)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

"Electric vehicles, solar panels, and humanoid worker robots...and the WINNER IS...","I say Tesla (TSLA) has an upside of 1000% over the next 5-10 years. First Musk will perfect his robots in Tesla plants, and then he will replace the vast majority of Tesla auto factory workers with robots. Tesla's EV's will be the hands-down cheapest and best American electric vehicles, due to greatly reduced labor costs. Maybe Tesla cars won't sell well for a while, you say, because ""everyone hates Musk"". That's ok, with whatever Tesla vehicles don't sell, Musk will simply deploy them all as massive fleets of electric self-driving robotaxis that start undercutting Uber and Lyft all over America. There will soon be an energy crisis due to mass proliferation of AI GPU's, and electric vehicles. The fastest easiest solution to increase energy production incrementally is guess what...? SOLAR.  So then Tesla will make a killing by selling its state-of-the-art solar panels, and Chinese solar panels won't be able to compete in America, thanks to Trump tariffs. If skyrocketing silver prices becomes an issue, Musk will simply buy some silver mines like he said he might. Meantime, the Big-3 American Auto makers will be forced to replace their workforce with robots from Tesla, in order to lower their vehicle prices to compete with the cheaper and superior Tesla autos. Or maybe the Big-3 won't abandon UAW, and they'll all sink together. Either way Tesla wins. Musk will make sure worker robots are sold gradually in a strategic fashion, determining the Winners \[those who are allowed to purchase worker robots first, before competitors are allowed\] and Losers \[those who aren't allowed (or don't want to) purchase robots, and are forced to stick with American human labor\].",2025-05-01 13:30:07,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kcfyh4/electric_vehicles_solar_panels_and_humanoid/,24,stocks

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla chair denied reports of a search for a new CEO to replace Elon Musk, reaffirming the company’s commitment to its current leadership structure. This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.

[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected.

No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!

[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d)\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). 

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B–$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B–$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level. Heavy AI spending along with digital ad rebound trends pushed semis upward, they stated their sector focus remains on monetization of AI-driven engagement tools.

TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

Source: [https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA](https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA)

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

That said, I'm not blind to the risks:

P/E of 171 is insane by traditional metrics

BYD is eating their lunch in China and now Europe

Insider selling has been heavy (Musk, CFO, directors)

The new affordable model keeps getting delayed

What's your take?

Am I crazy for holding through this? Has anyone else noticed the energy business numbers?

GENIUS stablecoin and potential push for tokenization,"/\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...

It is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.

It is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.

The grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.

Wait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.

So we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.

Too bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",2025-05-22 13:58:33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ksytv8/genius_stablecoin_and_potential_push_for/,1,investing

Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow,"Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because ""Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City"" is a longer trip than ""Shanghai to Los Angels"".

And because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)

A natural question when you hear this is, ""if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?"" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**

I was going to title this post ""financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow"", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.

Who's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12½ cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.

Now, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow—but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.

Okay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.

So yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled ""sell everything"", because that's not their job.

Maybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money—like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.

Hell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.

What I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",2025-04-29 20:12:12,453,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kb4bkz/financial_professionals_mostly_arent_paid_to_care/,110,investing
Is PLTR or TSLA a Better Position for AI Growth???,"I want to increase AI exposure in my portoflio because I am really bullish on AI for the future. Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad.

Tesla reports 20% Q1 drop in auto revenue,"Brutal numbers from Tesla after the bell. 

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow. 

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

"Trade Wars and Treasuries, or, How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds
(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)","OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. 

**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.

## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***

Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. 

## **What is a Treasury Bond?**

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.

Let’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.

Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.

Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! 

As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.

This is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).

- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.

- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.

- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.

The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.

Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.

## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**

Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Think about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.

Here’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?

If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.

You might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!

*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*

This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**

I want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.

It’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.

Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:

- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.

- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.

- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.

These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.

The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:

- Deep liquidity

- Transparent, market-based pricing

- Long track record of stability

- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated

- Safe-haven status during global crises

When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.

## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**

Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.

However, there’s a downside:

A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.

That’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.

## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**

Now you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.

So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. 

This is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.

## **The Yield is the Entire Field**

So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. 

Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.

But that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. 

## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**

Aren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. 

An inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.

Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.

That’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.

That’s a sovereign confidence event.

Different animal. Nastier teeth.

## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**

Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.

## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**

Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.

This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.

## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**

Yes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).

But there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.

When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.

If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.

So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.

## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**

After reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!

No, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.

It’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    

As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.

I decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. 

Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.

The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.

Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.

## **What Can We Do?**

Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.

There’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead.

TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation,"

TL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.

---

I've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.

Current Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality

While Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:

Stagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline
Margin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume
Valuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation

The Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine

The Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:

* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques
* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)
* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)

Why $140-180 is Fair Value

A 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:

1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.

2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.

3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.

## Profiting From This View

Options for bulls(No not Caesars legion)  :
* Reduce position sizes to limit exposure
* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions
* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership

For bears (No not the NCR ):
* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility
* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward

For neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :
* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range
* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices

Risk Factors To My Thesis

I acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:

* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations
* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated
* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness
* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins

## Bottom Line

The market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.

At $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.

"2-fund, 0% TSLA, VOO replacement (aka, the F'ELON fund)","I've wanted to remove TSLA from my ETF holdings for years, but it's recently become a priority. I used the reasoning function in ChatGPT to look at how to do this as simply as possible within existing Vanguard ETFs.

I'm looking at replacing VOO specifically, but GPT can easily replicate this for VTI or any other index fund. I call it the **F'ELON-EZ = 70% VIG, 30% VTV**

Has anyone else purged TSLA from their holdings? What funds are you using?


EDIT: As many have pointed out, GPT appears to be hallucinating the holdings of VTV and VIG. Lesson learned for getting excited and posting this before double checking the data. 

I’m going to do this the hard way and post back later.

TSLA share impact of X debt.,"It my understanding that Elon financed at least some of the twitter acquisition by borrowing against TSLA shares. I also get the general concept of a margin call. 
I suspect the specific terms of this  debt are not pubicly disclosed.  
Is that correct?
Has anyone seen modeling of potential specific terms of this structure? For example, by a clever sell-side analyst.
Are terms available for ‘similar  or comparable’ structures as much as they could be similar? 

These terms seem both interesting and relevant.

How to remove exposure to an index component,"We seem to be getting a lot of the same question recently about how to remove exposure of an index component if someone holds an index fund.

Whether it's NVDIA because you think there's an AI bust coming. Or you don't want to own TSLA because of Musk - there are ways to remove exposure of a component in an index.

First - the easiest way to do that is to not hold that fund and find a different fund that fits your criteria.

But if you want to hold certain types of indices such as large cap indices but you want to exclude a large cap component - it is a bit more difficult.

These are the different ways from most complicated to simplest.

1. Roll synthetic short futures with equivalent negative delta.
2. Write equivalent negative delta using deep otm call credit spreads or naked calls.
3. Short the equivalent dollar amount of shares
4. Roll long short puts or put debit spreads.
5. If an inverse ETP exists, buy the dollar equivalent of the inverse ETP.
6. Use a model-based replication service (usually only avail through an SMA/UMA program) which supports trade restrictions.
7. Use a direct index solution which supports rebalancing. 

Some of these solutions require more trading effort and derivatives experience than the average investor. So unless you are familiar - don't do it. And it's not possible to use some of these techniques in retirement accounts.

For most investors - the simplest is #6 or #7. Many brokers offer direct indexing and/or managed accounts - for example:

Schwab stock slices - [https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices](https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices)

There are probably more ways - but these are the techniques of top of mind. And if anyone cares - I normally use technique #2.",2025-03-05 13:08:38,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j4b2bx/how_to_remove_exposure_to_an_index_component/,17,investing

I'm not trying to get political (and don't intend for this to become that) but I was disappointed to see my Schwab target date fund IRA held TSLA.

"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).  And has been sued for trying to manipulate stock prices [through outrageous claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-twitter-d2640adc) and [non-disclosure](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-sued-by-twitter-investors-delayed-disclosure-stake-2022-05-26/).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?  I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?

Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,"I’m not a Tesla expert, and I’m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here’s a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

Portfolio Critique - Simplicity and Confidence,"Hey everyone, just started investing in a brokerage this year. Previously been 100% in crypto and it’s time to get a bit less volatile and more traditional in my investment strategy. I’m new to this, so help me out. I’m 30, looking for medium low risk, and plan to hold long term, minimum 10years, max 30. I want simplicity, growth, stability, and to be confident in my holdings. Here’s my portfolio set up:

Brokerage 
- 50% VOO
- 20% QQQM
- 10% NVDA
- 10% GOOG
- 10% TSLA

The individual stocks are ones I believe in and want extra exposure too, yes not simple and there’s overlap, but I’m confident in them. 

Roth IRA
- 75% VTI
- 25% SCHD

I could do more growth in Roth, but I just love the SCHD dividend dopamine and “game” of trying to accumulate SCHD. Even though it may not be optimal for growth, it feels good.

Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber’s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber’s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber’s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber’s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google’s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber’s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber’s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber’s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta’s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber’s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility—including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access—support Uber’s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber’s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber’s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber’s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%—a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber’s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber’s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks?,"Most of my money's in index funds, but there are a few stocks that I don't believe are worth paying for.

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",2024-12-28 14:03:52,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hodyic/how_to_invest_in_broad_market_minus_a_few_stocks/,6,investing

"First time beating the SP500 in 3 years. Also, reached my second goal of half a milli","I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts:

1. Is the volatility worth it?  
2. I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies  
3. Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes. 

Summary:  
Portfolio is up 193% since inception (Nov 2017) sitting at 595K  
Breakdown:  
Tsla: 45%  
Pltr: 25%  
Btc: 17%  
Clpt: 6%  
Abcl: 3%  
Rest less than 5%: Beam, Clsk, Nvda, AMD, Meta

I think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names.

2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",2024-12-03 13:49:45,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/,0,investing

"TSLA is contracting. Once 317 is breached, it will mark the next starting point of the trend.","The current monthly K-line pattern of TSLA is very interesting. It belongs to the typical type of high-level platform compression consolidation. 

After this wave retreated from the 488 high point, it repeatedly oscillated around the 317 level. Now it has contracted and narrowed for three months. This structure is very similar to ""accumulating force before explosion"". Once it breaks through, the direction will soon be clear. 

I made two plans: 

If 317 doesn't hold up, I will consider going short with swing strategy, looking at levels like 282 or even 248. 

If the price reverses and breaks down near 317, I will enter a mid-term call position, such as 340C or 360C, hoping for the platform to break through upwards. 

This structure generally does not recommend making sudden changes in direction in the middle. Unless a clear reversal pattern is observed on the daily or weekly charts. 

TSLA has always been an emotional stock, but now the trend seems more like an institution's move in hiding. The emotions are not as obvious as before. Maybe in the next two weeks, we will be able to see the direction choice.",2025-07-01 08:20:18,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1lp1i96/tsla_is_contracting_once_317_is_breached_it_will/,9,options
TSLA puts potential for tomorrow,"Technical analysis 

After a bullish run last week with TSLA gaining over 10.5% gains, it looks to be either consolidating or potentially moving back down to lower levels of support.

After market close, Tesla broke below a significant demand zone at the $312 area. Either of 2 things could be happening with this post-market move.

 1. There is a liquidity grab getting ready to take place, that will push TSLA back into our most recent demand zone and push the stock back up further (to $318-320 area). 

OR

2. It will continue its down trend to another substantial demand zone (between $308-304 area).

I believe we can use this recent break to determine which direction Tesla will go tomorrow. If it break back into and the above the demand with a liquidity grab, calls could be the play. If it retests and rejects, or continues down further, puts could be the play.

What do you think will be the move?

Net worth around 300k when I started investing this year. My goal is to reach a mill asap thru Tesla in the next few years. Betting my life on Elon...I know what ur all going to say but I'm firm. 

Anyway back to my trade, what would u all have done if u were me? I thought maybe I should've bought it back yesterday when I made 60 percent of the premiums and sold all my shares today and just sell puts. I recently learned selling puts is much safer than calls. I'm just kind of confused ATM, the good news is my call will expire worthless and I keep 100 percent of my premiums. 

I usually do weeklies and in my last 2 weeks I've been selling near and in the money for higher premium and buy them back around noon to 3pms Fridays. 

If there's any improvements I should make, plz let me know. 

Thanks",2025-06-25 21:39:58,60,https://i.redd.it/0giispcap69f1.png,51,options
Always execute too early,"Recently theres one thing drive me insane is that I always execute too early. I mostly play with 1 week dte, if a stock got huge green candle that day, i buy put, vice versa, it always result in me panicking when i suffer a loss that day, then in the next day i try to minimize loss and sold it. And every damn time, if i wait for one more day, i will have doubled/tripled my gain. Why is it always like this? Yes i sold my tsla puts early yesterday.

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

Tried too many strategies. Simpler is better.," I’ve gone through way too many trading strategies. Way fukkin much.   

I was waking up at 3AM Pacific inn seattle chasing low float breakouts, scalping options at open with golden zones, sometimes trading NVDA shares and options at the same time. I’d swing commons off 4H 200EMA, chase aftermarket runners, scalp VWAP reclaims, hunt gap fills. On top of that, I was doing covered calls, earning lottos and etc. 

I had 8 indicators, 5 Discord alerts, 10 TradingView alerts. It was too much. Yeah, I made money, but it was exhausting. I was chasing perfection instead of consistency.  It's like I was looking for a perfect wife. 

Now I’ve cut some shit out. Fewer setups for sure.  My screen time is down drastically. I only trade 2 hours a day now. My setup is simple as hell. 





My set ups.  If you want in depth on 'how to' then let me know. 

A. swing - 4hr 200ema break , Look TSLA, MRVL 4hr chart 

B. day trade small cap - mid day double top break out with volume, my fav. 

1. Open finviz
2. Locate top 5 gainers
3. Draw a simple horizontal line at pm high
4. Go in if it breaks this level

It's much than chasing news at pm. This happens twice 
 At open and then mid day. At open it's a chop fest.  And then there will another double if there is another momentum. Likely it's a double of open high.  

  SRM was nice. CERO too. 

You could run this same set up with options.  Find an earning gapper.  At open go in when it breaks. 


C. day trade options - follow the trend on a trend day and then reversal set up.  I use 9, 20, 50, 100, 200ema and vwap. RSI and macd for my entries.   Now this is all price action,  learning how to scalp. Tsla yesterday was a perfect example. I'm just riding the trend finding reversal points. Jump ship from call to puts back and force. I'm dancing with charts.

For those with experience trading TSLA. I feel like IV >>> Theta,"It feels like IV is SO fucking high and STAYS high that theta doesn't even play into it.

Example: TSLA is at $300. I sell a $350 call at 60 DTE for $20 premium. If the stock does fucking nothing by 30 DTE, the premium is probably still like $17. How can premium hold up after weeks and weeks? Is this stock just that volatile that unless it's 3:59 PM EST 0 DTE, no seller is gonna risk pricing it lower so that I can BTC at a good price??? The damn premium just won't fucking contract.

Do you guys even like trading TSLA? Is it even worth it?",2025-06-19 16:39:56,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1lfmv5b/for_those_with_experience_trading_tsla_i_feel/,19,options
Selling weekly options on Friday,"After taking some big hits trading earnings, I’ve been rethinking my strategy. I used to scalp and swing trade names like TSLA, but the stress and the potential for bag-holding after a fake dip isn’t worth it. Same with naked options, I’ve blown up enough to know better.

What I’m considering now is selling weekly ATM puts on large-cap, stable names like MSFT, AAPL, META, etc. Not around earnings too, just clean weeks with no major events.

this is my rationale:

* You get max premium selling ATM
* If assigned, I don’t mind holding the stock
* If not, I keep the premium and repeat
* And no gambling on earnings direction or IV crush timing

For example, sell a $480 MSFT put for \~$5.50 and you collect $550 if it closes flat or higher. If it drops a bit, I can roll or manage. Seems a lot more sane than trying to predict earnings or scalp all day.

Has anyone here run this kind of strategy consistently? How do you manage weeks where price hovers right at the strike near expiry? Do you close early? Any tickers or setups you avoid?

Would love to hear how others approach this style of trading. Looking for ways to build consistent, low-stress premium income without gambling every week.",2025-06-19 07:44:20,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1lf9vs8/selling_weekly_options_on_friday/,17,options
Naked Put Questions,"TLDR: Want to sell a 2-year TSLA naked put (\~$316 strike, \~$9,700 premium) to invest in MSTY for yield, while staying bullish on TSLA with 1,100 shares. My equity and margin requirement room should cover a significant drop, but I’m cautious about early assignment. Seeking insights on assignment mechanics, early exercise odds, European-style put alternatives, and risk management for long-term puts.

Hey [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), I’m planning to sell 2-year naked put options on Tesla (TSLA) to collect premiums and want to nail down the mechanics, risks, and alternatives, especially regarding early assignment for long-dated options. I’m using Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and have a bullish outlook on TSLA over the next 2 years, holding 1,100 shares. My strategy is to sell a naked put at the current price ($316 strike, \~$97 premium) and reinvest the premium into MSTY, rolling the monthly dividends for additional upside. I’m avoiding cash-secured puts to preserve my shares and capture potential gains. Questions below:

* When selling a 2-year TSLA put ($316 strike, \~$97 premium), how does assignment work? Does the OCC randomly select from all open short positions if the buyer exercises? How does IBKR notify me?
* Is it purely random who my counterparty is, or is there a buffer (e.g., does IBKR hold a pool of options to manage exercises, or am I directly tied to a buyer’s decision)?

1. Probability and Drivers of Early Exercise:
   * What’s the likelihood of early exercise on a 2-year TSLA put if it goes in-the-money (ITM)? I’ve seen estimates suggesting <5-10% due to time value, but are there concrete data points, studies, or anecdotes?
   * What triggers early exercise (e.g., deep ITM, minimal time value, irrational buyer behavior)? If TSLA drops 50–80% (e.g., to $100–$158), could a buyer exercise despite significant time value, and how real is this risk for long-dated puts?
2. European-Style Puts for TSLA Exposure:
   * TSLA options are American-style, but are there European-style puts on U.S. equities like TSLA (e.g., via Eurex, OTC)? If not, what’s the closest alternative for avoiding early assignment while retaining TSLA exposure?
   * Are there brokers or exchanges offering European-style single-stock options that could serve as a proxy?
3. Managing Risk in a Downturn:
   * If TSLA drops 50–80% and the put goes deep ITM, how do you manage assignment risk? I’d prefer to hold the short put until expiration, hoping for a recovery, rather than being assigned early. Is rolling to a higher strike/later expiration viable, or are put credit spreads better for capping losses?
   * Worst-case scenario: TSLA goes to $0 (bankruptcy). My 1,100 shares would be worthless, and I’d owe $31,600 on the put (minus $9,700 premium = $21,900 net loss). Would IBKR issue a margin call before expiration in this case?",2025-06-17 19:40:21,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1le3qwi/naked_put_questions/,8,options
"Zero-lag momentum indicator for options timing - NVDA, TSLA, SMR examples","Hi everyone!

I have been working on solving the age-old options problem: by the time a move is obvious, IV has already spiked. I built a zero-lag indicator that catches reversals as they happen.

Traditional indicators lag because they use moving averages. This reads momentum directly from price action - instant divergence detection. Unlike oscillators that just measure overbought/oversold, this reads the actual momentum flow within each candle.

  
Here are some examples: 

[TSLA weekly - \\""BE\\"" signal at $439, dropped to $222 \(-50&#37;\)](https://preview.redd.it/6mysklktnb7f1.png?width=2388&format=png&auto=webp&s=317e3c1fe3d96b6c0e8298c55581cda5d4fa1fc2)

[SMR weekly - \\""BU\\"" at $11.58, exploded to $31+ \(270&#37;\)](https://preview.redd.it/zvvr94yznb7f1.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc821a669caee80e42ae9753e41e950ffa685970)



More info in my bio.

  
Example: TSLA weekly hits $439, makes a higher high, but momentum shows lower high = bearish divergence. ""BE"" prints immediately. With MACD you'd wait weeks for confirmation. By then, puts cost 3x more.  
  
For NVDA at $95 - daily chart showed price made lower low, momentum made higher low = bullish divergence = instant ""BU"". Those $100 calls were dirt cheap.  
  
SMR weekly shows it works on small caps too - perfect for those high-risk/high-reward plays when you catch them early.  
  
Nothing works 100%, but the edge is catching reversals as they form, not after they're obvious. Daily for quick plays, weekly for swings that really pay.  
  
Happy to answer questions about how it's helped my trading.",2025-06-16 12:15:23,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1lcynim/zerolag_momentum_indicator_for_options_timing/,6,options
"Thesis still intact, but down -50%, sell or hodl?"," I bought TSLA call thinking Trump will win the election and TSLA will moon.  

I believed that.  and I'm a TSLA long.  Hodl all the way.  at one point it was down -65%.   I've traded TSLA for years and know how it became a meme stock. 

Here i was down close to -50%.   actually it went down to -65%, but couldn't take a screenshot.

In the end, I ended up with good profits.   but safe to say, I won't do that anymore.   I usually respect my s/l of -30%.  

Since this, i sized down.  I feel much better knowing even if i lose, i won't be tossing in my sleep.  I now know what my limit is.   I normally doesn't go this big.   I cap my size at 1/4 of this now.

Yes, I know a lot of people caught this move. But I wasn’t chasing headlines or blindly buying into the hype. I had a plan, and I stuck to it.
Reason for entry: Clean technical breakout setup + IV setup + watching unusual options activity
Risk control: Tight stop below key support, took partials early
I don’t FOMO into trades. I don’t rely on Elon tweets or hype headlines. This was a structured trade with defined risk and targets.",2025-06-11 09:48:26,0,https://i.redd.it/ukbrwj8k9b6f1.jpeg,9,options
TSLA calls,"I’m fairly new to options trading, last Thursday I saw Tesla drive off a cliff, when it broke below 300 it seemed oversold so I bought 10 contracts 6/13 310 C .   My price target is/was 330 . However, the Robotaxi launch Thursday may. E a catalyst to get the stock to perhaps 350 by Friday. With these contracts expiring Friday I’m assuming it’s much much safer to close the position Thursday at the latest. Anyone else holding 36/13 calls care to share your opinion or advice as to when to sell these calls? Thanks in advance!

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

"TSLA spread sold (0.05) and got bought back (0.15) in 20 minutes, typical or unique situation?","Today, I sold a **TSLA vertical call spread** — specifically, a **June 6 expiry** with strikes at **$320 (short call) and $322.5 (long call)** — expecting the stock to stay under $320 amidst growing market uncertainty. I sold for 0.05 and set a trigger for it (stop limit) to buy back at 0.15. This was my first attempt at TSLA call spread. Within 20 minutes of the first order, the second order got filled too. When I look at the stock price, the stock price did not move that much after I sold. I sold around 11:00 and before 11:20 the second one got bought. Is this typical of Tesla stocks? Or was it today? I did not expect a spread that I bought 0.05 to be bought back at 0.15 in 20 minutes without underlying stock moving too much.

Trader’s Tip: I Trade the A++ Setup (TSLA Example today) it takes patience,"One of the biggest shifts in my trading came when I stopped forcing trades and only executed A++ setups — trades where all timeframes are aligned and momentum is crystal clear.

✅ TSLA today gave 2 textbook A++ opportunities

1H, 15M, and 5M were fully aligned
TMO, MACD, and 50 EMA confirmed trend
No chop, no hesitation — just clean structure and flow
Entries confirmed by UT BOT and Parabolic SAR


📌 Trader’s Tip:

> If 1H and 15M are not aligned, walk away.
Wait for setups that scream “YES.” You’ll trade less, but win more.

Discipline pays, and patience can build your account.

Defending TESLA credit spread,"About a month ago, I opened a TSLA bear call credit spread: I sold the 315 Jun 20 call and bought the 320 Jun 20 call, collecting $1.30 in premium. I opened the position because I was bearish on TSLA, and also saw it as a partial hedge.

Now Tesla has surged upward unexpectedly, and I’m unsure how to proceed. My maximum loss is $3.70, which is essentially already reached — in fact, closing the position now would cost even more due to the current spread.

The thing is, I’m still bearish on TSLA. So my question is: how should I defend this position?

It’s clearly gone against me, and with a cost basis of $1.30, I’ve pretty much hit the max loss already. Should I just wait and hope TSLA drops before expiration, or should I roll it to a later expiration or higher strikes?

How would you handle a situation like this?",2025-05-27 08:54:04,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1kwnuv6/defending_tesla_credit_spread/,5,options

I built a script to get the best covered call combination at any time for all stocks,"What the title says. I spent some time as an options trader at a prop firm and we were using similar tool to optimize certain strategies we wanted to take. Built this for myself in my free time.

At a high level, it chooses a particular expiration date (5/30/2025 in the example above) and gets the option chain in real time using schwab's api for all stocks in the S&P 500, then calculates the potential payoff and risk profile for all the contracts in the option chain.

I used it this week to sell a CC on NVDA, but in the example above you can can see that I can sort it by annualized premium, downside protection, etc. and choose the one that I want.

For the above calls I filtered by annualized premium above 50% and downside protection above 5%

Enjoyed making this and curious to hear your thoughts/suggestions what I can add to make it more robust. I currently am thinking to get like an ""optimal roll"" for the position I am in.

China s BYD overtakes Tesla in Europe for the first time,"Tesla

\+1.76 percent

BYD Defense Force

0.91 percent

BYD:0.47 percent

China's BYD ( BYDDY ) is having another stellar year, while its rival Tesla ( TSLA ) is getting bad news after bad news.

In April, BYD's pure electric vehicles (BEVs) surpassed Tesla's registrations in Europe for the first time.

According to research firm JATO Dynamics, Tesla registered 7,165 BEVs, while BYD edged out Tesla with 7,231 registrations. Crucially, Tesla's pure electric car sales in Europe plunged 49 percent in April, while BYD's sales soared 169 percent.

Registrations are used as a proxy for sales as Tesla does not publish monthly or regional sales figures. Despite the news, Tesla shares were up 2% in early trading.

https://preview.redd.it/3pzwq18doc2f1.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cc5135472b62c4fa80d2ef8350a0df55970511



Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in the report, ""While the difference in total monthly sales between the two brands may be small, the implications are huge. This is a watershed moment for the European automotive market, especially considering that Tesla has led the European all-electric vehicle market for years, while BYD doesn't officially operate outside of Norway and the Netherlands until the end of 2022.""

Tesla's recent woes in Europe are no industry secret. Previous data has shown that Tesla has also seen a decline in registrations in key countries, including France (down 59 percent), Denmark (down 67 percent), Sweden (down 81 percent), the United Kingdom (down 62 percent) and Germany (down 46 percent).",2025-05-22 10:18:16,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1kstcby/china_s_byd_overtakes_tesla_in_europe_for_the/,6,options

Best Tickers to trade for account less than 2K USD,"Hi Options fam,

I'm a beginner options trader and have been trading options for a while. Thanks to Mr President's 90 day Tariff Pause news I lost a huge chunk of my account (Almost 60% 😭). I messed up by not having my SL for this trade, but now my broker doesn't allow shorting options and I'm using a cash account because I broke the PDT rule. 🥲
Can anyone advise me on other Tickers that I can look into for trading with a cash account? 
I was actively trading TSLA, SPX, SPY, QQQ and IWM now I can't trade any 😭
Would really love to hear your suggestions on how I can still trade with capital less than 2K.

Comparing two option trades,"I closed two May 16 call trades yesterday and would like to know why there was such a difference in the results and maybe learn something for the next trade. Here is a quick summary:

* TSLA $265 May 16 calls - Bought for $9.30 on 4/22, sold for $82.72 on 5/14. TSLA was trading for around $235 when the position was opened.
* NVDA $125 May 16 calls - Bought for $.44 on 4/24, sold for $10.40 on 5/14. NVDA was trading for around $105 when the position was opened.

Here is what I'm looking to understand: Why did the NVDA trade do so much better (over 2,000% gain) even though TSLA stock itself increased nearly 47% while NVDA shares only gained about 28%?  Is it just because the NVDA calls were so undervalued at the time?

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

**As another general rule, don't hold option trades through expiration.**

Expiration introduces complex risks that can catch you by surprise. Here is just one [horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipqkua/fridays_tsla_lesson_close_positions_before/) of an expiration surprise that could have been avoided if the trade had been closed before expiration.

Live $TSLA breakout: I mapped the coil April 27 — here’s my vertical spread plan,"**📈 $TSLA just broke out of a 2-week coil — and the setup was mapped in real time.**  
Starting on **April 27**, I posted publicly that Tesla was entering a classic compression pattern after breaching its expected move. It broke out of **the coil** Friday May 9th.

Most traders see chop.  
I see structure.  
And (May 9), **the breakout began**.

https://preview.redd.it/sn1fu4fcyc0f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bc37711eb11fa56815fe521dc456b9d528f6d7e

This isn’t hindsight.  
This was mapped.  
Now I’m executing.

# 🎯 My Trade Plan: Vertical Spreads (Post-Breakout Execution)

This isn’t about predicting direction.  
It’s about **selling premium after the move**, when volatility has expanded and risk becomes overpriced.

Here’s the **exact sequence I use** after a coil breakout:

1. **Wait for a pause candle** → A narrow-range bar or inside day after the breakout (shows price is cooling)
2. **Assess the expansion** → Did the move break cleanly? Is it holding above the coil range? Is the breakout at least 1x the size of the coil?
3. **Then — sell premium using defined-risk vertical spreads**: Direction of breakout doesn't matter.

**Direction of breakout doesn’t matter — here’s how I handle both:**

* 🔼 **If it breaks up:** Wait for pause → Sell **call vertical spreads above** the move
* 🔽 **If it breaks down:** Wait for pause → Sell **put vertical spreads below** the range

# 💡 Why This Matters

This isn't just a trade.  
It's part of a **repeatable edge** I teach through a 3-part breakdown series:

* **The Breach**
* **The Coil**
* **The Strike**

Each one was posted live, in real time — not after the fact.

If you're tired of chasing breakouts or relying on guesswork, this is a better way.  
I break it all down weekly in a series I call **The Scroll** — step-by-step lessons based on structure and probability.

Hope this helps someone slow down and learn to trade the pause — not the panic.

Tesla's Golden Cross,"Silly little me. I underestimated the importance of moving averages in predicting large price swings. Had I been more attentive, I'd have seen the golden opportunity that Tesla presented to us today.

Well, you live and you learn. I was still able to scalp a modest little 0DTE put when I noticed the RSI had dipped into the 80s. Still, I'd have preferred to make bank on a 0DTE call.

Has anyone here set up trades predicated on MA crosses? Seems obvious in retrospect that it's a signal we should be looking at, but like I said already--silly little me.",2025-05-09 16:08:33,0,https://i.redd.it/9m720bbbntze1.jpeg,24,options
I used AI to vibe code this table of high probability credit spreads for 5/16 & 5/23,"I've been working on this on and off for the last year or two, currently up to about 35k lines of code! I have almost no idea what I'm doing, but I'm still doing it!

Here's some recent code samples of the files I've been working on over the last few days to get this table generated:

[https://pastebin.com/raw/5NMcydt9](https://pastebin.com/raw/5NMcydt9)  
[https://pastebin.com/raw/kycFe7Nc](https://pastebin.com/raw/kycFe7Nc)

So essentially, I have a database where I'm maintaining a directory of all the companies with upcoming ER dates. And my application then scans the options chains of those tickers and looks for high probability credit spread opportunities.

Once we have a list of trades that meet my filters like return on risk, or probability of profit, we then send all the trade data to ChatGPT who considered news headlines, reddit posts, stock twits, historical price action, and all the other information to give me a recommendation score on the trade.

I'm personally just looking for 95% or higher probability of profit trades, but the settings can be adjusted to work for different goals.

The AI analysis isn't usually all that great, especially since I'm using ChatGPT mini 4o, so I should probably upgrade to a more expensive model and take a closer look at the prompt I'm using. Here's an example of the analysis it did on an AFRM $72.5/$80 5/16 call spread which was a recommended trade. 

\--  
  
The confidence score of 78 reflects a strong bearish outlook supported by unfavorable market conditions characterized by a bearish trend, a descending RSI indicative of weak momentum, and technical resistance observed in higher strike prices. The fundamental analysis shows a company under strain with negative EPS figures, high debt levels, and poor revenue guidance contributing to the bearish sentiment. The sentiment analysis indicates mixed signals, with social media sentiment still slightly positive but overshadowed by recent adverse news regarding revenue outlooks. Risk assessment reveals a low risk due to high probability of profit (POP) of 99.4% for the trade setup, coupled with a defined risk/reward strategy via the call credit spread that profits if AFRM remains below $72.5 at expiration. The chosen strikes effectively capitalize on current market trends and volatility, with selectivity in placing the short strike below recent price levels which were last seen near $47.86. The bears could face challenges from potential volatility spikes leading to price retracement, thus monitoring support levels around $40 and resistance near $55 would be wise. Best-case scenario would see the price of AFRM dropping significantly below the short strike by expiration, while a worst-case scenario could unfold if market sentiment shifts positively for AFRM, leading to potential losses. Overall, traders are advised to keep a close watch on news and earnings expectations that may influence price action closer to expiration, while maintaining strict risk management to align with market behavior.",2025-05-09 13:52:41,72,https://i.redd.it/rjz2kqw1xsze1.png,54,options

TSLA Traders: Last Call Before Today’s $270 Max Pain Move!,"Hey everyone!

Quick analysis into today’s [TSLA ](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA/options/max-pain)max pain level and how market makers might be tugging the stock—let’s see where they could be steering the price.

**What’s Going On?**

* Max Pain vs. Current Price
   * Max pain for today’s TSLA options sits at $270.
   * TSLA’s trading around $284 right now.
   * That means there’s a ≈$14 gap between where the stock is and where option sellers would love it to land.
* Strike Price Breakdown
   * Puts (red bars): Mostly hanging out from $70–$260.
   * Calls (green bars): Clustered around $290–$400.
   * The highest open interest is really out toward those edges—puts at the low end, calls at the high end.
* Price-Pain Gap
   * That $16 difference suggests there might be a bit of downward “pull” on TSLA today as market makers hedge.

https://preview.redd.it/azbx8nevzdye1.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3660d6d8daaf6aba048ef7a8fe999c90ed1090d1

  
**Why You Should Care:**

1. Price Magnetism
   * Market makers hedge to limit losses on sold options, and when expiry nears, they often push the stock toward the max pain level to minimize payouts.
   * Translation: we could see some selling pressure pushing TSLA closer to $270 today.
2. Sentiment Clues
   * Big put bets below $286 and call bets above it tell me folks are roughly neutral to slightly bearish on TSLA’s near-term moves.
3. Looking Back
   * If you check max pain for upcoming monthly expiries, today’s $270 is actually a bit lower than the future average, hinting today’s drag might be unique to this week.

**What To Watch & Possible Plays**

* Volatility Spike
   * Expect choppiness into the close as positions get unwound or hedged—especially around $270.
* Hedge Consideration
   * If you’re long TSLA stock, a quick hedge (like buying a short-dated call or put) might make sense to offset today’s squeeze.
* Options Strategy
   * Holding a far-out-of-the-money option? Think about locking in profits (or cutting losses) sooner rather than waiting for last-hour liquidity to dry up.
* Pin Risk
   * Heavy strikes around $270–$275 can act like a magnet. Gamma exposure may “pin” TSLA in that zone as traders jockey for position.
* After the Dust Settles
   * Once today’s options are toast, you could see a relief rally if the downward hedges unwind quickly.

**Bottom Line:** Max pain is a neat tool for spotting potential price currents, but it’s one puzzle piece. Always mix it in with your broader analysis—technicals, fundamentals, market news, etc.—before making a move.

Help me construct a calendar bear put spread on TSLA.,I’m thinking of putting on a calendar bear put spread on TSLA. My thinking is to go long OTM puts 4-6 weeks out with a delta of .30 while shorting OTM puts with 1-2 week expiration with a delta of .20. So I will be waiting of a bigger drop while I take out premium on the short leg. I would reload the short leg if the delta dropped to .10 rolling out a week to a .20 delta. Can you guys comment on this approach and what deltas and thetas you would initially target with this strategy?

I no longer belong in WSB,"I don’t understand options but have come to a self realization that I no longer belong in WSB.

It started 7 years ago when I made my first options play on AT&T stock and was pissed because I lost a few dollars due to the lack of IV but of course didn’t understand that.

Since then, I have gotten much better and even have a strategy. I’m not sure if it’s luck but I am all time profitable and have placed hundreds of trades now in addition to my long term investments.

Like I said, I don’t know much about options but I have learned a few rules that keep me from losing it all. 5 is the hardest. These work for me but that’s not saying I know shit. 

1) never force a trade
2) there is no obligation to trade every day
3) nobody knows what the market will do and trading really has almost nothing to do with the broader market 
4) never buy or sell on the news. Look at TSLA earnings call for example
5) nobody gets rich quick. Take your profits/losses quickly and GTFO",2025-04-29 06:33:16,270,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1kalobq/i_no_longer_belong_in_wsb/,105,options

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

Expiration introduces complex risks that can catch you by surprise. Here is just one [horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipqkua/fridays_tsla_lesson_close_positions_before/) of an expiration surprise that could have been avoided if the trade had been closed before expiration.

Assume the call is taxed at short term gains always (50%- high tax bracket california), assume the puts are taxed as long term gains (33%). Using my spreadsheet it appears to me the first 300k in gains would be taxed as stcg, then incremental gains after than are taxed at ltcg rate. Theres no scenario where i could lose money to taxes. Does this sound right?",2025-04-22 18:49:08,0,https://i.redd.it/p52iyxcq3hwe1.png,4,options
Delta Neutral Position and Options Activity on TSLA,"I believe many people expect TSLA earnings will tank when reported today after market hours. From all the reports sales are significantly dropping worldwide, which means they can't sell emissions credits, the brand image is tarnished, people are not renewing leases, and even turning in cars, plus they're taking a write down on BTC (when marked to market). There's more, but that's enough to set the stage. Yet somehow the stock is green today.

What I think I see. There is an overload of Put buying activity. Market makers have to buy the stock to stay delta neutral. I'm guessing this is what is driving the price up. If earning come out as expected after hours, and the stock drops, I'd expect the stock to tank Wednesday. When traders close their Put positions, the market makers will react by selling shares to remain delta neutral, effectively putting more sell pressure on the stock, driving the price even lower.

Would love to hear people's thoughts.",2025-04-22 13:18:22,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1k5deba/delta_neutral_position_and_options_activity_on/,10,options
anyone plan on buying puts on TSLA ahead of their earnings call today?,thinking about. Will probably do it,2025-04-22 08:48:53,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1k56rg1/anyone_plan_on_buying_puts_on_tsla_ahead_of_their/,63,options
Tesla Calls on TSLL vs TSLA,"Assuming there's a sell off and the stock price slides after earnings call I would rather load up on TSLL calls vs call on the actual stock itself.

Yes there is more volatility in the TSLL but as an investor you are betting on Tesla being back at $250 or higher than the TSLL makes more sense.

Looking at the Sept 25 10's at $1.30.  Which seems to have the most movement.

Back up position is the Jan 26 9.43 at $2.01

\*\*Please reply with some insight to this particular trade- not just to bash Tesla's fundamentals as I'm aware of the risk/reward return.
