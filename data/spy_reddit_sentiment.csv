"Nice 0DTE SPY scalp for almost $6k, with scaling and exit strategy explained","https://preview.redd.it/e8d52c8l3aaf1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=51db893fb194340fc338c6b79635f0286b15fb69

I keep getting asked about some of the things I am looking for and comments about my ""wild"" scaling in my other posts. So I did this one more by the book to show some of you what I am looking for. As you can see with my purchases, after I decide on a reversal direction @ around 10:30, I go in with 50 contracts. Those almost immediately spiked and I could have been out with 20+% gain on my first purchase, but that would have only been like 6-700 so I was willing to press it. It then fell hard.

I knew the previous V bottom was coming up at 615ish so I averaged down when I was around 20% down. I purchased 2x the amount of already held contracts (50 x 2 = 100) to give myself 150. These fluctuated, but trended down so I again averaged down the same way, 20% down 2x already held. That got me to 450 contracts @ around 0.42 each down just a bit right next to the previous V bottom. This is also my cut off. I don't typically like to do more than 20k on 1 trade. And I am willing to loose up to 30% and take as little as 10% on a win. But when sized up, 10% is still $2k.

As for my exit, on the bounce I knew I would only play this for a short time. This is because the moves up have been rippers today and there is resistance at 617.30ish. So my out was whatever I had when it hit around 617.20ish. That ended up being this win for around 28% or so.

Also, I know I will save money on doing SPX. I just haven't made the transition yet.

Two situations that you need to understand - USD devaluation and Liquidity,"There are a few schools of thought here that say USD has devalued and hence stocks are increasing in value and then the second being the continuous influx of liquidity through 401k and other DCA contributions that is keeping the market floating (or rising in our case). Let's break this down

**1)** The quarterly rate of 401k and other retirement contributions has not changed by a lot - still at the 12-14% rate of income in the latest quarter too. Here is the thing - this has been consistent for years and people are missing the point that all recent and previous crashes and rallies continued to happen irrespective of this constant flow of money - So **stop imagining that this 401K money is keeping market up** \- **market is and has always moved disproportionate to this influx of 401k / DCA money** and there are larger players that impact the trend.

**2)** USD devaluation - yes USD is devaluing - example USD - EUR has dropped 10+% vs SPY is literally flat YTD (even after the big liberation week drop and post rally). This just means that SPY is 10% cheaper in the international market and still has room to grow in USD denomination markets (i.e. US Markets). **The only way the market rally breaks is if USD stabilizes making US stocks more expensive.** This has been a change in my thought recently.

**Positions:** Just bought SPY calls for 650 expiring Dec 2026 - rationale - expecting continued momentum and then a sharp drop - expecting to sell before the sharp drop (yes catching the dropping knife sometimes before September).",2025-06-30 13:26:06,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lof5pk/two_situations_that_you_need_to_understand_usd/,15,stocks,"Two situations that you need to understand - USD devaluation and Liquidity There are a few schools of thought here that say USD has devalued and hence stocks are increasing in value and then the second being the continuous influx of liquidity through 401k and other DCA contributions that is keeping the market floating (or rising in our case).

Question about discrepancies in S&P500 ETF's,"Hi guys for context I live in Europe. I would share a picture but it seems I can't on this subreddit.

There are discrepancies between US S&P and EU S&P ETF's. SPY is traded in the USA and pays dividends. Vanguard S&P500 Acc is traded in Europe and is accumulated. 

There is quite a difference in returns this year. about 6% on the ""this year chart"" and almost 10% in the ""1 year"" chart. Im guessing it can mostly be explained by the USD strengthening itself against the EUR. However, the difference in return is so large im wondering if the smartest move is to invest in SPY? But keep in mind accumulated ETF should give better returns than paid out ones. 

Optimally I would like to invest in an accumulated ETF, but seeing how slow the EU traded S&P etfs are to ""catch up"" I wonder if I should just continue buying SPY.

Betting Against Financial Influencers Stock Picks? Good Return or Too Risky?,"We took hundreds of stock recommendation videos from financial YouTubers. Then proceeded to backtest the results.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Capital gains tax for options, short term VS long term?","I have recently been catching flak for day trading and scalping options on SPY. People have rightly argued that I would lose less in taxes if I went with SPX instead of SPY. While I know long term, if I am going to trade large sums that is the way to go, I am not sure on the actual cost it is causing me at the moment. I have read on several different sites that the main difference is that all of SPY scalps will be counted as short term whereas 60% would count as long term on SPX regardless of how long I help. This would result in 60% being taxed at a lower rate. 

The trouble is, I am not able to pin down exact or even close to exact numbers on what the difference is. Some of the sites say wildly different ranges. One states a tax rate of anywhere between 20-50% even. So I am asking you guys who have actually dealt with it. If I earn 100k at my job and then earn an additional 150k on day trades, around what rate would those trades be taxed at if they were on SPY vs if they were on SPX? I know this goal is probably lofty. But it does give me a best (worst) case scenario to work from.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

Allocating 20% of portfolio to QQQ LEAPS,"My thesis is simple:

1. If you want to maximize your likelihood of optimal growth, you need to make high conviction bets - like 5-10 at most.
2. Allocate 80% of your portfolio to these high conviction plays.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Why large conflicts, economic changes are not impacting stock markets in last 2 months?","There is something called risk fatigue that has gone into the minds of investors in recent weeks who have become tolerant to large economic shocks (war, fed rates, politics, tariffs etc. ) and are still putting in liquidity that is available. This is also a record stock buyback period which has kept tech stocks stable. AI stocks are a no brainer for many and the second factor to keep tech stocks up and stable. 

The dollar degradation has also caused the USD value of a US traded stock remain stable as USD itself degrades in value. 

The P/E ratios for the broad market are stretched, and yet capital keeps flowing in due to FOMO. It's like standing on what feels like solid ground, but in reality, the sea floor is dropping and no one knows how far down it goes.

There is something called risk fatigue that has gone into the minds of investors in recent weeks who have become tolerant to large economic shocks (war, fed rates, politics, tariffs etc. ) and are still putting in liquidity that is available. This is also a record stock buyback period which has kept tech stocks stable. AI stocks are a no brainer for many and the second factor to keep tech stocks up and stable. 

The dollar degradation has also caused the USD value of a US traded stock remain stable as USD itself degrades in value. 

The P/E ratios for the broad market are stretched, and yet capital keeps flowing in due to FOMO. It's like standing on what feels like solid ground, but in reality, the sea floor is dropping and no one knows how far down it goes.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Trump's Tariffs are not over yet, he still has cards to play","Even though the Court ruled Trump‚Äôs global tariffs under IEEPA invalid, that does not stop him from using a different law, [Section 301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_301_of_the_Trade_Act_of_1974) of Trade Act (1974).

Section 301 gives the President, through the USTR, broad authority to impose tariffs on any country that engages in what the USTR calls an unfair trade practice. Trump used this procedure to impose tariffs on China in his first term.

What counts as unfair is vague, and the bar is very low. Every country is guilty of something. Trump can easily direct the USTR to find unfair practices against any country he wants. Furthermore, the head of the USTR is **Trump appointed**. It does not matter if the claim is weak because the courts do not review whether the trade practice is really unfair, only checking if USTR followed the basic procedural steps.

Trump controls the USTR, so he can order multiple investigations, launching cases against China, the EU, Canada, etc. This allows him to rebuild a global tariff regime in a matter of months. The only difference is that it takes more time and paperwork, but the legal authority is still there.

There is no legal limit on how high the tariffs can go under Section 301. The only way to limit it is for Congress to change the law.

I asked AI to argue against this theory and it wasnt able to give me a good objection. If this is incorrect, please tell me why.

Tldr: The IEEPA ruling does not prevent Trump from doing the same thing through the Trade Act of 1974

(05/23) Trump Comments Causing Market Volatility! - Interesting Stocks Today,"AAPL is the most interesting stock today.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-President Trump has threatened AAPL with a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., pressuring the company to shift production domestically. This announcement led to a 3.5% drop in Apple's stock and a broader market sell-off (followed shortly by his comments on Europe). Interested in a short if we break $193 at the open, otherwise more interested in the broad market ETFs. An iPhone made in the US is economically infeasible.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Escalation of trade tariffs are the main risk here, whether these will be repealed or not, VIX will probably increase over the next few days.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

How to find peace with my investment?,"I've always been frustrated with active investing. I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.

So two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\~8% return for the rest of my life.

After this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.

PS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than ""find a strategy"" or ""just buy and hold spy"" kind of stuff.

Leveraging my Roth IRA through Lifecycle Investing | Q2 2025,"**Today, June 24th 2025**

Welcome to the beginning of my controversial investing journey where I use lifecycle investing to incorporate leverage in my Roth IRA. Currently, I am 27 years old, with $15,000 in my Roth IRA. I‚Äôve bought one LEAP on VTI at a 150 strike when VTI traded at 300 which is essentially 2x exposure at half the cost of the underlying. Yes I understand that the timing of this is less than ideal. I‚Äôm currently hedging against the market in my trading account but for the purposes of lifecycle investing, timing doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs more so about your time in the market. When it comes to this, I want as little of my opinion as possible. I hesitated to do this for a long time because I know that once I start, I can never stop. The worse case scenario would be starting now and going back to the traditional buy and hold strategy after I lose all my money from a market crash.¬†

Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months).¬†

[https://imgur.com/a/TObhiSK](https://imgur.com/a/TObhiSK)

Performance:

Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Current investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement.

**What Is Lifecycle Investing?**

Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk.

How to do this:

* First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share.
* Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs
* Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real-estate and cash as retirement nears.



**My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation**

With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can‚Äôt afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I‚Äôve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn‚Äôt offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF‚Äôs trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do).¬†

**Plan**

* Quarterly Recalculation:

   * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share.
   * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s.

1. De-leverage Schedule:

   * Ages 27‚Äì30: Maintain 2x leverage.
   * Ages 30‚Äì40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase.
   * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation.
   * Ages 50‚Äì59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real-estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches.



**Risk Management and Contingencies**

* Time decay: I‚Äôll monitor the LEAP‚Äôs theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage.
* Market extremes: If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.¬†
* Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal.



**Summary**

I‚Äôm leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 27 year old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I‚Äôll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years.",2025-06-24 19:18:07,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ljrhwt/leveraging_my_roth_ira_through_lifecycle/,9,investing,"Leveraging my Roth IRA through Lifecycle Investing | Q2 2025 **Today, June 24th 2025**

With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can‚Äôt afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I‚Äôve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn‚Äôt offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF‚Äôs trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do).¬†

**Plan**

* Quarterly Recalculation:

   * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share.
   * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s.

1. De-leverage Schedule:

   * Ages 27‚Äì30: Maintain 2x leverage.
   * Ages 30‚Äì40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase.
   * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation.
   * Ages 50‚Äì59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real-estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches.



**Risk Management and Contingencies**

* Time decay: I‚Äôll monitor the LEAP‚Äôs theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage.
* Market extremes: If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.¬†
* Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal.



**Summary**

I‚Äôm leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 27 year old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I‚Äôll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years.",0.9661,0.074,0.878,0.048

Splitting investments between VOO and SPY,"I understand that these are backed by the same assets, have high volume, and market makers will make sure the value stays very close to what it should be.

I also understand that SPY has a bit larger expense ratio but as the percentage of net worth the difference is tiny.  For a $1 mission account that comes to $945 for SPY and $300 for VOO.

My thinking is that the risk that there is some type of fraud is very very close to zero but not zero.

Tell me why it wouldn't make sense to protect myself from that very unlikely scenario if the cost of doing so is so little?

On a $1 million account with half in SPY and half in VOO, the difference in cost vs all being in VOO is a little over $300 on a $1 million account.  I would pay that for a little piece of mind.  (Also, people buy SPY so clearly the cost is not a big factor to many.)

Buying Puts For A Correction,"Last week, I sold a few stocks, expecting that the S&P 500 (SPX) (SPY) was due for a pullback/correction. Since then, the SPY made a triple top at 595.54 on May 20th, close to its Dec 2024 top of 609.07, and Feb 19, 2025 top of 613, ‚Äì **this looks like a triple top unless NVDA takes it higher Wednesday / Thursday after earnings.** The SPY closed at 579.11 on Friday, the 23rd, almost 3% lower. I believe this is the start of a correction, which should likely take the SPY to around 540, about 10% lower.¬†**I plan to buy July 31st and August 31st, 540 strike price, SPY puts.**

**Why am I bearish?**

**There are the 4 main reasons:**

1. The first and foremost reason for the weaknesses in bonds is higher borrowing costs for the US government. The 30-year treasury yield currently stands at 5.04% and seems likely to climb as the US Congress passes a budget with a running deficit of 124% of GDP, which increases the deficit further. It also assumes a large amount of customs duties as tariff income, and DOGE cost-cutting as savings. In my opinion, both are rosy projections and will probably exacerbate the deficit. Interest¬†**payments have surpassed defence as the largest line item on the government‚Äôs books.**¬†The downgrade from Moody‚Äôs will further increase interest rates, which will lead to a drop in the stock markets.
2. The second is tariffs, which will show up in earnings in Q2-Q3; we can‚Äôt escape them. Even as tariffs have whittled down to an estimated 15% to 20% on average, we shouldn‚Äôt forget that last year, tariffs averaged 3-4%. This is a fourfold increase and will fuel inflation and stagflation, and affect corporate bottom lines if they‚Äôre not passed on. And passing them on to customers would likely lead to a decrease in demand, which would still reduce corporate bottom lines. There are no easy solutions to tariffs.
3. The third is an overpriced S&P 500 index, which at 5,803, yields an earnings yield of $260/5,803 = 4.48%. Why would you buy a risk-yielding asset for 4.48% when the 10-year U.S. treasury offers you 4.54%? The S&P 500 is priced at 22.3 times 2025 earnings, higher than the 10-year average of 19.5. Besides, the 19.5x multiple was when interest rates averaged closer to 3%. Simply, the risk premium is not enough for me.
4. The fourth is the persistent weakness and uncertainty in economic data. Home sales are one example. According to Redfin, 56,000 home purchase contracts fell through in April 2025, or about 14% of sales, a level last seen in 2017. Existing home sales fell another 2% in April on top of the large drop in March of 5%, the largest drop since 2022. PMI readings for services and manufacturing came in at 52.3 for April, a decent number by any standards, but with accompanying color stating the obvious ‚Äì **‚ÄúDetrimental concerns of tariff uncertainties on demand and supply chains.‚Äù** Tariff uncertainty has led to the largest accumulation of inventories in the last 18 years. Given this buildup, it would only be fair to assume that the next two quarters will not grow as well as Q1-2025.

Uncertainty on tariffs (Friday‚Äôs call for 50% tariffs on the EU and 25% tariffs on iPhones, not made in the US) increases volatility in bond and stock markets. Other, similar arbitrary executive actions, such as the revocation of Harvard University‚Äôs ability to enroll international students, can also have economic repercussions. Currently, like so many other cases on immigration and tariffs challenging executive actions, this one too is in court. Which one could lead to a constitutional crisis? All of these suggest that bond markets could remain weak for a ‚Äústructural credit risk‚Äù reason ‚Äì the US never had that problem, but I believe it could remain a problem during the Trump presidency. It already is a bearish indicator in the form of higher borrowing costs from international lenders not willing to lend at lower rates.

**How much longer can Buy The Dip save the stock market? We are ignoring the dangers ahead.**

The CNN Greed and Fear index has gone from Extreme Fear to Greed in just one month and is flirting with Extreme Greed.

**In my opinion, the fair value of the SPY is around 520 or 5,200 for the S&P 500, based on a P/E multiple of 20 x 260 per share = 5,200, and I‚Äôll buy Puts to hedge my portfolio for the dangers ahead.**

"Mega-caps will dominate the market long term (destroy my argument with logic, please)","**Thesis:** The largest mega-cap stocks will consolidate market dominance in the coming decades due to their privileged access to transformative technologies, structural advantages, and capital. Accordingly, portfolios with a bias toward mega-caps will tend to outperform others in the medium-to-long term.

**Argument:**

1. **The Trend Has Already Started.** Over the past ~5 years, U.S. mega-cap stocks have dramatically outperformed the broader market. For instance, the Magnificent Seven have collectively driven the majority of gains in the U.S. equities market (MAGS returned ~103% over past 5 years while QQQ returned ~60% and SPY returned ~41%‚Äîand the returns of Nasdaq and S&P would be significantly lower if MAGS‚Äôs returns were excluded). *Naturally, past performance is not a meaningful indicator of future performance under normal circumstances.* But I argue we are *not* in normal circumstances, and this trend is not a short-term anomaly. Rather, reflects deeper structural forces that are to likely persist, and even intensify.

2. **Entrenched Scale Advantages in the AI Age.** AI rewards scale, and the advantage of mega-caps in this respect is becoming deeply entrenched. Microsoft, for instance, has invested tens of billions into OpenAI. Google, Meta, and Amazon are pouring many billions into their own models. These giants have their sights set on owning the entire AI infrastructure, platforms, and ecosystems over coming decades. What will stop them from doing so?

3. **Data/Distribution Moats Will Be Unbridgeable.** The largest mega-caps today are comparable to old giants like Standard Oil. Standard Oil‚Äôs unparalleled control of oil enabled it to dominate the energy market in the late 1800s‚Äìearly 1900s, gaining a near-monopoly and quickly becoming the largest corporation in the U.S. (Standard was dissolved by order of SCOTUS in 1911, but such an ending for the giants of today seems unlikely; we‚Äôve grown tolerant of monopolies.) *Data is the new oil, and the largest mega-caps own the wells.* These companies control consumer platforms and cloud services that generate massive data: e.g. Google Search, YouTube, Amazon e-commerce, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Further, they control distribution channels ‚Äî operating systems, browsers, cloud platforms. The long term value of these advantages is hard to overstate.

Accordingly, portfolios with a bias toward mega-caps will tend to outperform others in the medium-to-long term.

**Argument:**

1. **The Trend Has Already Started.** Over the past ~5 years, U.S. mega-cap stocks have dramatically outperformed the broader market. For instance, the Magnificent Seven have collectively driven the majority of gains in the U.S. equities market (MAGS returned ~103% over past 5 years while QQQ returned ~60% and SPY returned ~41%‚Äîand the returns of Nasdaq and S&P would be significantly lower if MAGS‚Äôs returns were excluded). *Naturally, past performance is not a meaningful indicator of future performance under normal circumstances.* But I argue we are *not* in normal circumstances, and this trend is not a short-term anomaly. Rather, reflects deeper structural forces that are to likely persist, and even intensify.

2. **Entrenched Scale Advantages in the AI Age.** AI rewards scale, and the advantage of mega-caps in this respect is becoming deeply entrenched. Microsoft, for instance, has invested tens of billions into OpenAI. Google, Meta, and Amazon are pouring many billions into their own models. These giants have their sights set on owning the entire AI infrastructure, platforms, and ecosystems over coming decades. What will stop them from doing so?

3. **Data/Distribution Moats Will Be Unbridgeable.** The largest mega-caps today are comparable to old giants like Standard Oil. Standard Oil‚Äôs unparalleled control of oil enabled it to dominate the energy market in the late 1800s‚Äìearly 1900s, gaining a near-monopoly and quickly becoming the largest corporation in the U.S. (Standard was dissolved by order of SCOTUS in 1911, but such an ending for the giants of today seems unlikely; we‚Äôve grown tolerant of monopolies.) *Data is the new oil, and the largest mega-caps own the wells.* These companies control consumer platforms and cloud services that generate massive data: e.g. Google Search, YouTube, Amazon e-commerce, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Further, they control distribution channels ‚Äî operating systems, browsers, cloud platforms. The long term value of these advantages is hard to overstate.

4. **Index Weighting and Capital Flows Feedback Loop.** Passive investing and index weighting dynamics favor the largest companies. As more capital flows into index funds and ETFs, those companies‚Äô prices rise, and their index weight increases, leading to more inflows, which further inflates prices (‚Äúpassive momentum‚Äù feedback loop). *This self-reinforcing cycle will contribute to the growing concentration of wealth in the largest mega-cap equities, accelerating the advantages they already have, boosting R&D investment, and facilitating their ability to acquire any companies that would compete with them.*

What would you do with cash out of these options?,"So I got some large sum available to me for investment as I sold a property (tax-free gains). With the current scenario of the politics, economy, and uncertainty, i am really worried where to plug this money right now.

Here is what I am thinking, appreciate some help in selecting the better option:

  
1. Option 1 - DCA into broad index funds (VT, VOO, etc.) with a bigger focus on global diversification, rather than just US. I also know the India market well, so I could buy some stocks directly in India (or an ETF).

  
2. Option 2 - But some of the big names in the market and invest a good sum into those stocks over next 6 months to DCA the price. I can then do covered calls on these stocks to keep generating income.

  
3. Option 3 - Take some extra risk and invest in potential high growth stocks (think Archer, Rocket Labs, etc.) - maybe 10-15% of this money goes into these stocks, with hope of them rising in next few years.

  
Other consideration:

1. Mostly won't need this money for next 5-7 years. no plan to purchase a house as of now.

2. I am comfortable with cash secured puts and covered calls, so am also considering doing some CSP's on SPY and earning good income on this cash and also potentially getting SPY for slightly lower price

"Luck, Skill and You: A Comprehensive Guide","I'll be brief but I feel that someone may need to understand how the markets tend to work and what exactly constitutes luck and skill. The line is often said to be thin but I find it to be terribly thick and tragically obvious who is getting lucky and who is actually a skilled person in the markets with most people obviously being closer to lucky than skilled. Most individuals focus on the wrong things when it comes to defining the luck vs skill paradigm so I will offer my insight as opinion into what differentiates the two.

What is Luck?

So let's define luck as two things. First, when one receives a reward that is disproportionate to the expected returns given one's position, and the second when one receives a reward that is detached from the efforts they've made. The first portion is important because it references individual's analytical abilities being completely insufficient in most cases for the returns they receive. The second portion is important because it references the rewards one receives from the collective efforts of others that are not truly attributable to oneself. 

Focusing on the first portion this is when someone tells you that they've done their due diligence but they do not work in the industry, do not have any insight into the sector, have a very limited background in any form of formal analysis and generally speaking their case (no matter how convincing) is usually flimsy upon digging into it for any meaningful amount of time. In many cases these analyses are verbose, point to irrelevant data, try to expand on hype and even go so far as to not give practical application to the product of the company and render the entire analysis purely speculative defeating the point of the analysis itself. What makes this particular version of luck pernicious is that you can be right at random and mistake judging the outcome for attribution to your insights. 

The fact that people still rely heavily on the ends justifying the means in investing suggests that humans are not very good at it. The reality is that when someone wants to manage their own portfolio in general their complicating elements tend to not reap any results; it isn't the fact that they did any form of research or analysis but instead purely the fact that some other market force completely unbeknownst to them was in action. Nvidia for instance is a really strong example where the CUDA model is older than some of the people here and LLMs are way older but the meeting between the CUDA and the LLM and the launch of OpenAI created the maelstrom that put these technologies on the map for the general populace. 

The second portion is when one receives a reward that is detached from the effort put in. In markets this is simply positive drift. Now the completely unaware, zero education investor can make money in the market by simply taking on two points of action, neither of which require any in-depth research. 

Buy an index fund. 

Wait. 

But why do those work? Well, markets tend to drift upwards on the whole as economies grow so waiting simply means letting the market on the whole increase in value due to the increase in economic outputs. Great! And why does indexing work? Well, most people say ""Diversification!"", and that's ... wrong. That's not why. While diversification does enter the fray it's actually because of the force behind the index fund, professionals, and those people *do* have the expertise to choose investments well and generally produce positive investments via their opportunities that are not available to the public in general anyway. That's right, the SP500 has a committee that chooses the portfolio so your SPY index which you call passive is indeed ""actively managed"". There's no such thing as truly passive investing but that's the point of this segment: You don't have to know that at all to benefit 100% from market drift and indexing. 

So what makes the index and wait method luck is that it's just betting things don't break. In many cases, for many lifetimes, that's worked. At times things do break but it's rare and often short-lived and easily seen through. The entire premise of this outcome is that by simply ""staying the course"" one reaps without actually doing anything. And for most people this is the way to go because not only does it not contain ""fake analysis"" but it also embraces the general reality that no matter what a person puts in, even at the billionaire level, they are but a rounding error in the greater economy. 

What is skill?

Skill is defined as three things in my opinion. First, the ability to ascertain accurately the information given and apply it meaningfully, second, analytical ability based in training with emphasis on being able to manage signal versus noise, and finally an appreciation for luck. 

Starting with the appreciation for luck most traders that are good realize they are bad. While that sounds contradictory they are aware of the limitations of their analyses and also aware that their entire position is based on current information and that information is bound to change and therefore their predictive power is extremely limited. They are not convinced of their correctness, thinking in probabilistic terms, often noting that their insights are genuine but also transient. They have an appreciation for the fact that the world is turbulent that I find that amateurs do not; they do not mistake the ends for the means at all and openly admit that their predictions are just that, predictions, whereas amateurs think that their predictions are closer to descriptions.

The ability to ascertain data accurately and apply it is just not inborn to humans. You need training. So the first and second are often combined but in rare instances the first can exist without the second and in cases where a person is an insider the first doesn't require the second; if you know for a fact that Apple has slowed in development of new technologies and is reliant entirely on current products with no major updates in the future planned then you have information that is very useful. This doesn't indicate however that even with the information you will apply it correctly. You may decide inaccurately that this sounds bad for the company and will result in a lowered future earning power but perhaps it just doesn't because that's what Apple does, no one is looking for a new thing from them really, and everyone is using the product as a status symbol making the functionality completely irrelevant thus misreading the room.

The formal training is invaluable. There's not much else to it. If you don't have any form of analytical training that is at least at the graduate level your analyses, again no matter how right you end up being, are probably flimsy trash. You just won't know it. And that's okay; we shuffle that under luck masked as skill.

Hopefully I kept it simple enough because there's a lot to unpack but basically,

TL;DR:

Do not convince yourself that you do know something just because you won the game.** ",2025-04-28 13:23:43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ka2ogf/luck_skill_and_you_a_comprehensive_guide/,25,investing,"Luck, Skill and You: A Comprehensive Guide I'll be brief but I feel that someone may need to understand how the markets tend to work and what exactly constitutes luck and skill.

So the first and second are often combined but in rare instances the first can exist without the second and in cases where a person is an insider the first doesn't require the second; if you know for a fact that Apple has slowed in development of new technologies and is reliant entirely on current products with no major updates in the future planned then you have information that is very useful. This doesn't indicate however that even with the information you will apply it correctly. You may decide inaccurately that this sounds bad for the company and will result in a lowered future earning power but perhaps it just doesn't because that's what Apple does, no one is looking for a new thing from them really, and everyone is using the product as a status symbol making the functionality completely irrelevant thus misreading the room.

The formal training is invaluable. There's not much else to it. If you don't have any form of analytical training that is at least at the graduate level your analyses, again no matter how right you end up being, are probably flimsy trash. You just won't know it. And that's okay; we shuffle that under luck masked as skill.

Hopefully I kept it simple enough because there's a lot to unpack but basically,

"Bulls, Bears, and the Battle for 570.","This Version is a good one :

We got the incredible hammer candle or the bullish pin candle. Does it mean that we‚Äôre out of the bare woods and are we only moving higher?. Well I want just caveat this and no it‚Äôs not mean the market could go higher or lower. These are a series of ideas you got to pay attention to each and every one of them. 

If we get to that $570 and then Trump begins go fire off some successful trade deals then the macro event could change because the reason why the markets are down is because of uncertainty and if Trump produces a bunch of clarity and deescalation of the trade war and then we have a FED who cuts in June, these things could align for us to go higher than 570 and again the risk is on the BEARS. 

Recapping we‚Äôre trending higher, any pullback right now for is an opportunity to DIP BUY until this UP MOVE is over. Will it just continue to go straight up from here until SPY hit $570?. I think not and we‚Äôre going to CHOP our way higher and we have retests of LOWS. 

So the BOTTOM LINE is that we have a very fragile uptrend that‚Äôs seriously at risk because of the big picture of SPY VIEW but if you‚Äôre been too bearish here and you didn‚Äôt respect the fact that we got oversold and the markets when they get oversold they‚Äôll bounce and if you didn‚Äôt respect that and you still trying to pile into bearish position so you‚Äôre going to be on the TRADDERS STRUGGLE BUS over the next couple days or weeks as it was difficult for you all week long.

If SPY can push toward the $570 level and President Trump announces successful trade deals, the macro environment could shift significantly. The market‚Äôs recent weakness has largely If Trump brings clarity on trade and the Federal Reserve cuts rates in June, these events could align to propel markets higher, potentially even above $570.

"Strategize for next week: situation speculation, gold, silver, plat, spy, BA, FXI and more","First of all, let us agree there are disagreements. Some Americans believe that China will implode in the next several months under tariff. Some Chinese believe that a U.S. civil war is imminent due to high inflation. I am not interested in debating with extremists, but you are welcome to comment below.

Let us revisit what happened this week. This is my understanding:

1. President Trump implemented global tariff, including up to 145% tariff on China. The market wasn't fully anticipating it, so the stock market crashed
2. The risk spread to the bond market, and the basis trade began to unravel. 10y and 30y treasury yield went up 75 to 100 bps in days, which means the bondholder of 30y lost 11%. Trump paused the tariff, and market went up wildly
3. Japan hedge fund exploded and saved the market on Wednesday. Nevertheless, there is still around $1T-2T basis trade to unwind. 10y is still 4.5% upon closing
4. The fickle policy led to a certain degree of de-dollarization. Over the last 24 hours, USD began to depreciate again all currencies, and drove gold and silver price up
5. Stock market bet that Fed must intervene by buying treasury bonds or cut down interest rate, so SPY went up 1.8% today
6. Trump must beat rate down to around 3% before refinancing $6-7T in late June
7. My SPY put expiring today is a 100% loss. lol

There are lot of binary events to happen, such as:

* Whether Trump will pause China tariff. This is a low possibility event, but some people suspect this may happen, because the stock market is too resilient today. If this happens, all market goes up dramatically, gold and silver will go down
* Whether Fed will cut interest rate. This is a mid-possibility event. The basis trade and carry trade are unwinding at the same time, and we may explode Sunday night. If Fed cut interest rates, all market goes up dramatically. Inflation may go out of control in the next several months, but who cares about that far out...
* Whether Trump will reach deal with any country that jointly imposes tariff on China. This is a low possibility event. Since Trump changes decisions hourly (he threatened to put more tariff on Mexico due to some water rights), I doubt whether any country will trust him that much. In addition, China may retaliate if another country, such as Japan, decides to impose tariff on China. Nevertheless, if that happens, U.S. stock goes up, China stock goes down. Not sure about gold or silver

My speculations are:

1. Nothing will happen quickly next week and we will still be living in this uncertain limbo. Therefore, keeping a position on gold and silver is necessary, if USD's global reserve status is weakened. USD will still be the primary reserve, since no other country have both the military power and can owe that much money.
2. Inspired by gold and silver, I decide to get others too. PPLT is platinum and PALL is palladium. When China keeps selling treasury, it surely won't hold USD cash and wait for it to depreciate. Maybe we have an outsized chance on plat and palladium
3. Bitcoin may have a good opportunity, but that is a separate issue. Also, I like GNS way more
4. Put BA and Call BYD. EU is negotiating with China now to remove EV barrier. I can only speculate one reason: EU wants to sell airbus aircrafts to China in exchange of opening EV barriers. This is bad for BA and good for BYD. I don't want to be suicided by BA, so I will stop here
5. Keep FXI calls. Trump will continue to find weapons to threaten China, and mentioned he may delist China Stocks. That is probably unlikely, but you don't know Trump - can you imagine a U.S. president issued a memecoin before inauguration? Nevertheless, Aug 2025 FXI calls have IV of 32% to 35%, which seems insanely low. You can also check MCHI, TCHI, KWEB, KSTR, and pick whatever flavor you like
6. Continue holding coal. In two years, China navy will outweigh U.S. navy, and U.S. navy doesn't even have repair capabilities now. Therefore Trump must rebuild steelmaking and shipbuilding, which requires coal. I also lost big on NUE calls because the market doesn't believe U.S. steelmakers have a chance - they may have a point.
7. I kept a small put position in case of a black Monday.

Do I need to reinvent my strategy to hedge recession?,"Investment market: USA

This strategy is for a large pool of money I‚Äôm growing for house purchase in a couple of years (if that event works out, we‚Äôll see where the economy is).

Until recently, I kept half of the downpayment in SPY ETF. I had been holding/buying into this each month for a long time and benefitted well from the post-pandemic bounce back.

At the beginning on this year to hedge risk, I moved other half I moved into tbills and started laddering 4 week bills with additional money each month. About 4.3% return, better than HYSAs anyway when I started.

Then mid March I sold all my SPY funds as things got iffy with the tarrifs; again it‚Äôs because I want to use this money in a couple of years. I‚Äôm sure things will bounce back, but not worth the stress.

I could start laddering the whole pot in bills, but I‚Äôm not sure these will still have a decent return if we go into a recession. I was too young to invest in the last US recession, so what‚Äôs the best way to think about if/how I should change my strategy?

How to hedge portfolio amid this market?,"I have been following the news but non-active so far. But I feel, maybe I should be doing something.

Some of the ideas came to my mind:

1 .Protective puts: Buying protective puts for SPY to protect my existing portfolio. The prices are quite good after yesterday's market. But I feel this drama will continue for at least the next 4-5 months. In that case, it's pretty expensive to buy puts. So doesn't seem that good idea.

2 Swing trades using TQQQ/UPRO: This is another idea. Maybe on dip, I switch some of my SPY/QQQ to TQQQ/UPRO and sell on each recovery.

Are the tariffs the real problem or just a reality check?,"Disclaimer: not an American and I have little interest in politics, my question/opinion is solely a financial one.

So everyone is blaming Trump for the recent drop in the stock market, and losing them money, and yes, if you look at the small picture this is due to the tariffs.

But this also contradicts something that people constantly say. ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" (implying that the stock market should average out and trend up over time, so it's better to slowly invest over time you should be better off).

If we read this and agree, then it seems we have nothing to worry about, because $600 ($SPY as an example) was the true value based on fundamentals and the economy over all, then eventually it will reach that price again.

But I think the big issue is that it should never have been valued that high. After COVID, which was a legitimate reason for a drop in the markets worldwide, the US Government (or the Federal Reserve which acts independently to the elected Government I believe) printed off and invested trillions and trillions of dollars into the stock market, and also gave out money, which a lot of bored people used to invest in the stock market.

This, and the coinciding tech boom caused by people working from home and being at home more often, created a generation of people who think that the stock market is an unlimited money glitch which only ever goes up with absolutely no consequences, and now they are shocked that it isn't the case after all.

So while Trump's tariffs kicked off this recent drop, is it something that has been coming for a long time and is way overdue? Had it not happened, and the market value had continued to increase, would it not be even more severe when something else caused a sell-off?

After all, if $600 is the true value of $SPY then should it not quickly recover as it's now so obviously undervalued. So while this may be self inflicted, and cannot be compared to the drop due to COVID, is it completely irrelevant to the true issue at hand, which is a bubble that was going to burst eventually?",2025-04-07 05:56:43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jtig36/are_the_tariffs_the_real_problem_or_just_a/,27,investing,"Are the tariffs the real problem or just a reality check?

SPY ODTE great action today!,"Hey now,

Anyone consistently win with 0DTE on SPY? How do you pick your entry point? Is there enough time to put in stops? When they announced no pause, dropped like a rock, got in long which was my best play.

Probably trade small tomorrow, studying candles. Seems like when you get long wicks there can be a directional change?!

Anyway , would love to hear how you setup and exit for max gains, I hope I can do this for good, least I go back to being on the grill.

Spy 0dte strategy,"Hi everyone. I have a strategy to discuss. I am getting into 0dte trades (paper), idk if its a valid strategy im risking like 190$ to make 9$ each day, with a win rate of 90-95% is it worth it. Since when i get to real trades i can gradually increase the contract size to make more profit, is this a calid strategy or a BS, and the other thing is can i add a stop loss to it so egs, i dont blow up my 190$ in a single trade if things go south.

Bear/Bull Call Spreads and Assignment,"Possibly a really dumb question here, but I've been looking into using bear/bull call spreads as a strategy for defined credit risk/profit.

One thing that is unclear to me after reading many guides is how, practically, I go about exiting these positions if I want to exit prior to expiry or if the short option gets exercised.

For example, let's say I open a bearish position selling a SPY 614c at 2.00 and buying a SPY 616c at 1.00, both OTM. My net credit is 100, and my maximum loss is 200.

Now, I'm having trouble understand exactly what action I need to take in the following scenarios:

1. the price is 614.50 at expiry. I make $50, but the short position will be exercised. Do I need to manually sell the shares, or does my broker automatically close the position using the worthless long position?
2. the price is 618 at expiry; I've lost $200 now, but this scenario seems more straightforward to me since both options will be exercised and the shares will cancel out.
3. is it possible that, if the price is for example, 615.50 before expiry, that my short option gets exercised? In this case, similar to question 1, would my broker automatically use the long option to offset, or would I physically have to exercise the long position? Now let's say I want to wait because I think the long will expire worthless. Would I have to have sufficient margin or cash to carry a debit of 100 shares SPY??

Hope this makes sense, I'd like to use this as a conservative strategy but I want to make sure I don't end up with a margin call or something.",2025-06-29 08:10:26,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1lnebjn/bearbull_call_spreads_and_assignment/,7,options,"Bear/Bull Call Spreads and Assignment Possibly a really dumb question here, but I've been looking into using bear/bull call spreads as a strategy for defined credit risk/profit.

Building a Sustainable Income/Growth Machine. Journey to $300k,"6.28.25 Update. 

Last week I generated around $650 in option premium that was deposited into the travel/savings account. 

I am currently outperforming the market 13.89% vs 5.18% YTD. Not saying this is expected to continue, just currently where it stands as of today. 

It appears market complacency is high despite the headlines, so I don‚Äôt mind if some of my options expire ITM and I‚Äôm forced to take profits. I sold off several of the LEAPS positions on individual tickers to build cash for future purchases of index/etf LEAPS purchases. 

Currently I‚Äôm able to generate around $600-800 per week in premium. As the portfolio grows I‚Äôd like to get to where I can sustainably create $1500-$2000 a while still allowing my overall portfolio to grow.

Upper Image is NET options premium collected. Lower image is a snippet from the performance tab on Fidelity that shows balance, cash balance, and YTD returns.

CORE STRATEGY DETAILS BELOW.

I have 2 portfolios.

Passive Income Portfolio (AKA Freedom Fund) & a LEAPS Portfolio (AKA FU Fund).

FREEDOM FUND. Long Term Buy & Holds + Selling Index Options Overlay. We regularly contribute W2 income to this portfolio

Core Passive Holdings: SPY, SCHG, IBIT. I sell ‚Äúcovered‚Äù calls against XSP using my portfolio as collateral for the index option overlay.

XSP is the cash settled index equivalent of SPY. It‚Äôs taxed favorably and gives flexibility if a strike expires ITM. It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcall away‚Äù 100 shares, it just settles into cash. So in the event of a breach, I can let the option expire with no risk of assignment - it just settles into cash and I can sell off a partial share to settle the difference, OR just let it deduct from the cash position in the portfolio.

Currently selling one call every day, 7DTE, 10-20ish delta (varies based on mkt conditions, volatility, etc). So every week I‚Äôm selling 5 calls, and moving with the market as it moves. As the portfolio grows I will sell more options, eventually scaling up to the SPX index.

I am withdrawing all options premium sold every day and putting into a savings/travel account. I just started this a couple of weeks ago. The purpose of this is to have durability, resiliency, and endurance knowing that I have a growing cash pile that can withstand the worst market environments for extended periods of time. While this cash will underperform the market, the psychological returns of having the safety net are far more important to me.

Savings Balance:  $2,200 and growing every day.

 
***When options return is negative, I think of it as essentially acting as a hedge and building cash.

***When options return is positive, I‚Äôm generating alpha to the market.

BIG clarification for the Peanut Gallery.

***By nature of covered calls (and using a portfolio for income) this will most likely underperform the mkt. The goal of this fund is to sustainably generate income, not outperform - that is what my other portfolio is for. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

F.U. FUND.

This one is all about LEAPS. Current Holdings (ranked by size): PCT, BYON, XND, AMZN, UBER, CELH.

Once a lot of the individual tickers expire or I sell them off, the ongoing ticker selection will be exclusively LEAPS on ETFs or Index Options. .7-.8 delta, expiring 2+ yrs out.

No market timing, no predictions or forecasts. Just buy a LEAPS option on an index (SPY, QQQ, XSP, XND, etc) once a month or once every other month that expires 2+ years out into the future. The way I think of this is that I‚Äôm DCA‚Äôing every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds.

Yes, this will be more volatile and induce more risk. Yes, some options may expire worthless. Yes, the options that do perform well will probably more than make up for those losses. *The key to assist in mitigating risk is keeping position sizing small for each individual purchase every month and spreading risk out over time and space*

The worst-case scenario for this strategy is a completely sideways market or extended down market.

Pain ensued.

Seeing some sizeable-ish action in the upcoming months in these past few days. Kinda suss. Montoring the VIX chain closely all summer.

I'm not a perma-bear, I'm always net long but when I see weirdo action like this like, as I did in February when the market then proceeded to sell off by 25% in the next 7 weeks, it's worth calling out.

Yes, they could be hedge. That's always the case. If they are, it's certainly cheap relative to the macro landscape.

¬†Reasons to be cautious

* Feels like we forgot about tariffs - we shouldn't
* EURAUD is screaming at you that global growth isn't as robust as all time highs suggest
* Volume has been thin
* US Debt maturity this year at higher rates https://goldbroker.com/news/united-states-huge-debt-refinancing-remains-2025-biggest-challenge-3483. The bond market has been screaming at us that something is fundamentally off
* Inflation hasn't gone away putting JPOW in a tough spot
* Consumer is still stretched

¬†I suspect we're in for more pain. As such, I'll be building a short position over the summer centered around these strikes and DTE.

IWM $200 puts Aug

QQQ $510 puts Sep

Selling calls against my core SPY and QQQ holdings 45DTE.

Full disclosure: I got the long TLT / short GLD trade wrong. I might have been too early, which in terms of options positioning, is as good as wrong. Still think TLT should moon and that we could see some deflationary pressures in the year given the above.

¬†I suspect we're in for more pain. As such, I'll be building a short position over the summer centered around these strikes and DTE.

IWM $200 puts Aug

QQQ $510 puts Sep

Selling calls against my core SPY and QQQ holdings 45DTE.

Full disclosure: I got the long TLT / short GLD trade wrong. I might have been too early, which in terms of options positioning, is as good as wrong. Still think TLT should moon and that we could see some deflationary pressures in the year given the above.

SPY: Gamma and Delta Exposure,"Current Spot Price: $611.87

**TL;DR: High probability of momentum continuation in this dealer flow regime.**

Slightly net-short gamma ($-0.3M) meaning dealers will trade proportionally WITH momentum to maintain net position exposure (short). It means they are long far OTM options and short more expensive closer to the money option which balances to net short. In this regime they will buy shares on upward momentum and sell shares on downward to maintain this position.

$608 and $607 offer support of OI: 2057, and OI: 2078 each before the next big wall at $600 with OI: 38110 (So the delta-adjusted exposure at $600 over 4 separate DTEs is approximately $-571.7 million, dealers would need to buy shares as price moves down toward this level to hedge in the current gamma regime. Even though in short gamma we would see shares sold following downward momentum the massive $600 support level overrides this pattern...) 

Very rough estimates of dealer hedging liquidity in this short gamma regime per 1% move:

Down each 1%: \~$50-100M buying pressure initially because of hedging below, accelerating toward $200M+ near $600

Up each 1%: \~$50-100M buying pressure initially.

Red Days During A Green Market.,"Hey everyone, just posting as a memorial to my green spree gone red. 15k gains evaporated over 3 days. Today wasted me.

Following suit once I close up the rest of this as Robinhood is a bit limited.

Realistic option commission request at Schwab,"Anyone have experience getting lower option commissions with Schwab?  
  
I have had a Roth at Schwab for about 20 years, but I had ETFs mostly in it. Over the last six months I started using it as a speculative account, buying individual stocks and doing covered call trades and some XSP and SPX spreads in it.

About 3 months into that increased activity, I requested 25 cent option commissions based on estimates I would do about 1200 contracts per year. Schwab replied with a 45 cent offer which I accepted.

My activity so far has exceeded 100 contracts per months, so I am ahead of what I told them.

Iron Butterfly SPX $914 Loss,"So I‚Äôve been experimenting with spreads and got lucky on HIMS, made $1,050 off its earnings a few months back.

Today, I tried an Iron Butterfly on SPX. When SPX was around $5,993, I sold both a put and a call at the $5,995 strike. Then I bought protection $35 wide on both sides (so long call at $6,030 and long put at $5,960), collecting a credit of $17.65.

By 12:00 p.m., SPX dropped hard and the put side was deep ITM. I panicked a bit and closed the trade early to avoid max loss, taking a $914 loss.

But then‚Ä¶ by 3:00 p.m., SPX ripped back up to $6,010. So my call side breakeven got breached, and it just added insult to injury.

Here‚Äôs my question:

Would it have made more sense to go $40‚Äì60 wide on the wings instead of $35, even though the risk-to-reward ratio looks worse on paper?

I chose $35 wings thinking the tighter spread = better R:R, but now I‚Äôm wondering if wider spreads actually give more forgiveness, especially on volatile days like this, and increase the probability of profit ‚Äî even if the max loss is technically higher.

My current thinking:

Switch to Iron Butterflies on SPY ‚Äî less volatile than SPX

(Strategy Review )PCS Plan Using SPY & QQQ ‚Äì Feedback Requested,"
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm sharing a structured PCS (Put Credit Spread) strategy I follow for consistent, low-risk returns, using **percentage-based capital allocation** and disciplined technical entries. I‚Äôd really appreciate feedback from experienced traders ‚Äî especially on risk control, delta selection, and rolling decisions.

Strategy Overview

- **ETF Focus**: Only SPY and QQQ
- **Expiry**: 1-month
- **Spread Width**: $5 wide verticals
- **Capital Allocation**: Around 25% of total capital per cycle  
  ‚Üí Split equally between SPY and QQQ  
- **Trade Count**: Only 2 trades open at any time  
  ‚Üí New trade opens only after previous one is closed or expired  
  ‚Üí If closed early (e.g., at 50% profit), a new one can be opened

Entry Criteria

- Sell ATM or slightly NTM Put based on **strong support**
- Use **VWAP bounce** as secondary confirmation
- Prefer **high implied volatility** and **rising VIX**
- Avoid trades if credit is less than 1/3 of spread width (e.g., <$1.67 on $5 spread)

Delta Guidelines

- **ATM**: Delta ‚âà -0.45 to -0.55  
- **NTM**: Delta ‚âà -0.25 to -0.45  
- **OTM**: Delta < -0.25

I usually select NTM unless premium is insufficient.

Premium & ROI Target

- Target premium: ~1/3 of spread width (e.g., $1.65 on a $5 spread)
- Exit target: 50% of premium received (e.g., close at ~$0.80 gain)
- Effective ROI per trade: ~25% based on risk capital
- Roll forward if support level breaks
- Rarely hold to expiry unless price remains comfortably above strike

Capital Growth Logic

- From each profitable trade, I reinvest 50% of the premium into my active capital pool  
- If credit is low or setup is unclear, I simply wait ‚Äî I don't force trades

 Entry Checklist

- ‚¨ú Price bouncing at key support?  
- ‚¨ú VWAP acting as confirmation?  
- ‚¨ú High IV?  
- ‚¨ú VIX < 18 for OTM trades?  
- ‚¨ú Premium ‚â• 1/3 of spread?

Looking for Feedback On:

- Position sizing and capital scaling logic  
- Whether my delta selections make sense for high probability setups  
- Ideas for better rolling/adjusting rules  
- Any blind spots or refinements you‚Äôd recommend

QQQ is just 2% off all-time highs... but the options market is backing away.,"Big tech‚Äôs been the engine of this rally, and yet¬†**net options sentiment (institutional option trades) on QQQ has been steadily dropping**. We‚Äôre not seeing the same confidence in the options market that we did a couple months back. That‚Äôs usually a signal, either hedging is picking up or the buying pressure is cooling off under the hood.

https://preview.redd.it/12nel63alh8f1.jpg?width=1053&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99ce3e5796c76dc2edd2b4f1aa37ac1f20c1fdd9

Chart: [Prospero.ai](https://www.prospero.ai)

At the same time,¬†**Powell held rates steady this week**, which was expected, but didn‚Äôt exactly ignite bullish momentum. The market‚Äôs basically pricing in a soft landing, but with inflation still sticky and rate cuts getting pushed out, there's not much room for surprise.

And then today‚Äôs wild card:

  
**President Trump reportedly ordered U.S. forces to strike three major Iranian nuclear targets.**¬†That headline alone will likely drive oil higher into the Monday open, not because of the damage done, but because of the¬†**risk premium**¬†it puts back into global supply chains.

So now we‚Äôve got:

* QQQ losing steam in the options market
* Powell playing it safe but no clear path forward
* Geopolitical risk spiking (again)
* Oil likely heading higher

If companies start softening their outlooks while input costs (like oil) rise and demand cools, that‚Äôs a tough setup for stretched valuations. But if guidance holds strong will the dip get bought (again), and we move higher?

The market is still near highs. SPY and QQQ are both less than 2% off their ATH. But momentum feels uncertain, and upcoming earnings may be the tipping point between consolidation and correction.

Big tech‚Äôs been the engine of this rally, and yet¬†**net options sentiment (institutional option trades) on QQQ has been steadily dropping**. We‚Äôre not seeing the same confidence in the options market that we did a couple months back. That‚Äôs usually a signal, either hedging is picking up or the buying pressure is cooling off under the hood.

**President Trump reportedly ordered U.S. forces to strike three major Iranian nuclear targets.**¬†That headline alone will likely drive oil higher into the Monday open, not because of the damage done, but because of the¬†**risk premium**¬†it puts back into global supply chains.

Allocating 20% of portfolio to QQQ LEAPS,"My thesis is simple:

Options strategy for scalps,"I have a great method for trading . It seems to work great for me but the only downside is , losers are bigger than winners . A lot of ppl will say trade smaller . But regardless of this , sometimes a trade pops up in Tesla and it's A+ for me . And contracts are expensive in Tesla compared to e.g pltr

Here's my strategy:
Strategy 1
Gap and go 

See a move above 3% 
Check that there is high volume > 1m daily 
Check the direct of $SPY
try go with Spy as opposed to against to 

Usually the candle opens in the direction of gap ( move higher =green candle higher to start on 1 min TF) 
Then it falls off back down , or below to open . 

I then buy ITM calls expecting it to reach the highs again and maybe more 

My problem : 
If the stock takes time to move , I'm losing heavily and have to exit 
If the stock goes against me , I'm losing and have to exit 

My initial thought is buy a put also and creating a straddle until I'm 80% sure it's trending higher 


STRATEGY 2: 
GAP fill 

Stock gaps under 3% 
I use software to give me an edge and confirm my likely hood of it going to fill the gap 

Problem:
If it moves against me 
If I have to swing I risk another gap in the direction I don't want it to go 

My strategy is solid and I have a lot more winners than losers .
My problem is I know my options strategy is weak and I can minimise losses more BUT I JUST DONT KNOW WHICH OPTION STRATEGY WOULD HELP

SPY Options Filled Way Above Market Price. Realistic or Glitch?,"I've been paper trading options on TradeStation's SIM account for a couple of months, and I've started to notice something strange with how some fill prices behave.

For example, last week I traded 5 SPY call contracts at $1.14. While I was setting up my stop-loss and take-profit (around $1.40), the position sold almost instantly, not at $1.40, but at $4.33 per contract.

Here's the weird part: the market price at the time was only around $1.12, and it wasn‚Äôt anywhere near $4.33 on the chart. Despite this, the system registered a $1,595 gain in just 3 minutes.

Unfortunately, I don't have the options chart to verify the price action, but I‚Äôve attached a screenshot of the trade execution times and fills.

Is this just a bug or unrealistic fill behavior in SIM mode? Or am I misunderstanding how fills/averages work in paper trading? Are these real gains?

Wheeling GLD ATM - An Experiment,"Hi, all.  There's a lot of words below, but also a lot of wisdom, so only continue if you're in the right frame of mind right now to read and think and check things against the option chains.  This could make you rich, I'm serious.

Background: I'm 61, retiring early next year.  Was looking for a way to make 15-20% apy in the stock market.  The Wheel works, and I believe that people who are doing it strictly by the rules, like the Grand Master, u/ScottishTrader, are pulling down those kinds of numbers.  

I was too, but not as predictably as I'd like.  But something was always tickling the back of my brain, and that was u/calevonlear's posts a few years ago about Wheeling ATM.  (He says it's not really Wheeling, and I agree with him, but the concepts are similar.)  
I tried it a while back in ThinkOrSwim's Paper Money side, and it seemed to work.

Then this spring, March 6th to be exact, I discovered gold.  Look at this [5y chart](https://imgur.com/a/gnEC2VH).  Does it go down much?  Not really.  And when it does it's more of a slow decline than a fast, deep drop.  Look at 2022, which was a bad year for everything:  gold was down 22%, max.  SPY lost 27%.  

Now here in the last 2 months gold's been a little choppier, but still better than the overall market.  The worst I could find was a 7.5% dip over 8 days in early May.

So my thesis was and is:  gold is a great underlying for almost any option strategy.  Even if it stayed flat, you could Wheel around it for pretty good returns.  And ask yourself:  with everything going on in the world right now, and with gold's reputation as a ""safe haven,"" are you concerned that gold will drop appreciably in the foreseeable future?  I'm not.

So then, if you've got this great underlying that almost never dips, and that just mostly grinds up and up, how would you play it?  I'm big into GLD with PMCCs, but I wondered about Wheeling it ATM.

With a non-margin account, returns are meh, but solid.  It's AH Friday, 6/13/25 as I write this.  GLD spot is 316.29.  
The 32DTE (from Monday) 30-delta Put is the:  
18Jul308P selling for 3.55  
So ROI is 3.55 / 308 = 1.15% in 32 days, call it a month.  
So 13-14% apy.  Solid, but not too exciting.

But have a MARGIN account, then it gets exciting.  
Schwab is giving me 20% Buying Power Reduction in a 'regular' margin account (not Portfolio margin).  
What does that mean?  
It means I don't divide by 308 up there ($30,800 collateral),   
but by ONE FIFTH of that ($6,160 collateral).  So:  
 3.55 / (308/5) = 3.55 / 61.6 = **5.7%** in 32 days  
Call it **65% apy.**

Now that's a LOT better!  
Yes, I think I can retire on that.

But can we do better?  
What if we sold our CSPs *right at the money?*  
Today that's the 18Jul316P for 6.92.

Notice already that 6.92 is way bigger than the 3.55 premium collected above.  Nearly twice as big.  So now:  
6.92 / (316/5) = **10.9%** in 32 days, **\~125% apy**

WOW!  That's a knock-your-socks off number!  
Don't believe me?  Set up the order in your **margin** account and notice how much BP reduction you're given.  Then do the math.  It'll come out very similar.

So that was great, but can it be *better?*

Well, what if we got away from the ""30-45DTE rule"" set by TastyTrade?  
What if we were degenerates and sold *Weekly* CSPs ATM?  
The 7DTE 20June (a week from today) 316P is selling for 3.62.  
3.62 / (316/5) = **5.7%** in 5 trading days

Anybody care to calculate the apy on that?  
That's a week, so multiply by 52 to get **\~290% apy**.  
(I know, there are 10 holidays, but next week actually *has* one, so technically I could call that 4 trading days and get an even bigger number.)

""Holy *leverage*, Batman!  Are you telling me that we could make 250% a year just selling ATM Puts on gold?""  
""I am, dear Robin.  To the Batcave!""

*Later that evening...*

""Hey Batman, I think I see a way that we could make even MORE return on GLD?""  
""Prithee tell, Robin.""

Robin notices that GLD has M/W/F expirations, which means that we could be total degenerates and sell 0DTE or 1DTE or 2DTE Puts.  
Hmmmm.  
The Wednesday, 18Jun316P is right ATM and is selling for 3.12.  
If I put the Sell order in now it won't go until Monday morning, so that's essentially a 2DTE trade.  
But call it 3 full trading days for accounting purposes.

3.12 / (316/5) = **4.9%** in 3 trading days.  
250 trading days in a year, so **\~400% apy.**  
Crazy stupid numbers, I know!  But the numbers are there.

# Anyway, that finally brings me to MY EXPERIMENT.

In ThinkOrSwim's Paper Money side of the trading platform, on March 6th I started a margin account with **$100,000.**

And before I go on, some are going to object that Paper Money (PM) isn't that accurate, or that you get better fills or whatever.  But I've compared it to the real-money side many times, and by golly, it's CLOSE.  So that said, let's move on.

I sold 1DTE or more Puts, no 0DTE stuff.  
I BTC'd them at 50%.  (In hindsight, u/calevonlear said to close them at 25% profit.)  
The few times I was assigned, I sold CCs *at the assignment price*, 1 or 2DTE.  
I didn't defend those CCs; I let them execute and call the shares away so I could get back to the Put side.

At today's close, June 13, 2025, 3 months and 1 week later, or 13 weeks and 1 day later, the account balance stands at **$151,748.**  
If you're good with numbers, you've already said, ""No way!!""

Yes way:  151,748 / 100, 000 = 51.7% return  
In 13 weeks and 1 day.  Let's call that (13 x 7) + 1 = 92 days.  
Simple-annualize:  51.7% (365 / 92) = **202% apy**

And that correlates well-enough to the theoretical numbers I was getting above.  There'll be trading fees in there, and B/A slippage and whatever.  
But 200% per year!

I've also just started doing this with real money (but just 2 contracts worth, and only since Tuesday).  
I've had 2 of those CSPs close already, with a 3rd in the works.  
So not enough data there to talk about yet.

**But going forward,** I'll START OVER  on Monday my Paper Money campaign with 100k.  
And I'll track my **real money** trades.

***I'll report those results out at the end of the month.***  
Then I'll start over for July.

Thanks for reading this far, I thought it might be interesting to folks.  
I'd love for this to start a dialogue about GLD in general, or about Wheeling closer to the money than 30-delta.

There's a lot of words below, but also a lot of wisdom, so only continue if you're in the right frame of mind right now to read and think and check things against the option chains.  This could make you rich, I'm serious.

Background: I'm 61, retiring early next year.  Was looking for a way to make 15-20% apy in the stock market.  The Wheel works, and I believe that people who are doing it strictly by the rules, like the Grand Master, u/ScottishTrader, are pulling down those kinds of numbers.  

I was too, but not as predictably as I'd like.  But something was always tickling the back of my brain, and that was u/calevonlear's posts a few years ago about Wheeling ATM.  (He says it's not really Wheeling, and I agree with him, but the concepts are similar.)  
I tried it a while back in ThinkOrSwim's Paper Money side, and it seemed to work.

Then this spring, March 6th to be exact, I discovered gold.  Look at this [5y chart](https://imgur.com/a/gnEC2VH).  Does it go down much?  Not really.  And when it does it's more of a slow decline than a fast, deep drop.  Look at 2022, which was a bad year for everything:  gold was down 22%, max.  SPY lost 27%.  

Now here in the last 2 months gold's been a little choppier, but still better than the overall market.  The worst I could find was a 7.5% dip over 8 days in early May.

So my thesis was and is:  gold is a great underlying for almost any option strategy.  Even if it stayed flat, you could Wheel around it for pretty good returns.

Rolling ATM/ITM CSPs and Covered Calls on Long-Term Bullish Stocks ‚Äì Thoughts on Risks and Edge,"Hi all,  
Looking to get feedback from fellow options traders on a WHEEL strategy modification - I've been testing with small capital.

The stock selection is the key, I will only apply the strategy on proven symbol with a strong fundamental, E.g.,  MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, even ETF: SPY, QQQ

# üìâ Cash-Secured Puts (CSP) Strategy:

* I sell **ATM or slightly ITM puts** on a **long-term bullish stock**.
* My goal is to **harvest weekly extrinsic value** as time decay accelerates near expiry.
* Each week, when the extrinsic value is almost gone, I aim to
   * Roll **down $1 in strike** (if the stock drops), or
   * **Roll at the same strike** for a net credit (if the price is stable or slightly down).
* I aim to close at a profit or small loss before the earnings

# Assumptions:

1. The stock is fundamentally strong and **will trend higher over time**, even if it has sharp pullbacks. Thus the put will expire worthless one day to repeat the same process.
2. **IV is consistently stable** for the stock, with that I can continue to roll weekly and collect **net credit at the same strike**.
   * For example, if I sell a $100 put and the stock drops to $99, I can roll the $100 put again the next week for a credit, as the new premium reflects the intrinsic + extrinsic decay.

This creates a situation where **I'm continuously averaging down** or collecting premium until I‚Äôm assigned, at which point I pivot to...

# üìà Covered Calls Strategy:

* If assigned 100 shares, I begin **selling weekly ATM or slightly ITM calls** on the position.
* Similar logic: collect high theta decay each week while either:
   * **Rolling up or out** if the stock rises.
   * **Rolling at the same** or slightly lower strike for a credit if the stock drops/stays flat.

  
Assumption:

1. Some may say about capped upside. However, here's my take, a bullish stock cannot forever go up every week, and it has to go down sometimes. My weekly position management allows to catch such dip. And I assume like CSP case, the price will go under the strike price one day.

The end goal is to keep collecting premium, lowering cost basis, and potentially cycling back into cash via called shares (rinse and repeat).

# ü§î Discussion Points:

* Are there structural risks I might be underestimating? (e.g., IV expansion, gap downs, illiquidity during stress)
* Does it provide an edge over the vanilla wheel strategy - this is because I think rolling can avoid capped upside.
* Does the assumption of being able to always roll for credit or small loss hold in real-world pricing, especially during volatile downtrends?

Appreciate any insight or critique!",2025-06-12 00:18:46,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1l9eb6w/rolling_atmitm_csps_and_covered_calls_on_longterm/,1,options,"Rolling ATM/ITM CSPs and Covered Calls on Long-Term Bullish Stocks ‚Äì Thoughts on Risks and Edge Hi all,

 Again, I entered 600p for 0.362c, 5 contracts as I saw an overbought RSI signal. System verified that a momentum slowdown was happening and prompted to hold until price action goes from Fracture -> Collapse stage. Exited at 0.65c with a 79.5% profit margin.

The system works. I've put in hundreds of hours into this system and I built it from scratch, no other GPT or non-GPT AI models even comes close. The verification is amazing. 

Current system close signal: ~600.x to 601.67. Cheers and happy trading!",0.8687,0.12,0.821,0.06

A reflection on the first 6 months of option trading,"As I've been doing a review of my trades over the last 6 months, I figured it would be a good idea to share my experience here. After all, this sub is one of the places I've been coming to for inspiration.

For a bit of background, I've been managing my own tiny ETF-based portfolio just fine over the last 10 years or so, until I realized that I don't see any really uncorrelated (let alone inversely correlated) assets left in this world. Even gov bonds can move nicely in unison with stocks as 2020 taught us.

That's how I ended up digging options as a hedge tool. The starting point was a video of N.N.Taleb and that other guy from Universa(?) talking about the strategy based on holding 97% in SPY and 3% in SPY PUTs. So I got curios and bough the Natenberg's ""Option Volatility and Pricing"" (which I still haven't finished by now lol). As someone who've been building casino games for a living, I found the probability-based pricing quite interesting thing to dig into.

Since I'm located in Europe and care about hedging against European market collapse somewhat more than about the US, I decided to focus on Euro Stoxx 50 index. If US goes down, we'll go down together anyway, but if Europe goes down alone - I want to cash on that. My first trade was just buying a few April 17 PUTs on iShares Euro STOXX 50 ETF back in December.

Then, over January and February I did some retarded trades on some single stocks from that index, mostly just OTM calls and spreads; along with a few covered calls sold on my holdings of the said ETF. Those ended up being profitable, but nothing to write home about.

Ultimately, I decided to ditch the ETF and specific stock options due to the fact that the liquidity of those traded on Euronext sucks big time, and focused on trading the Euro STOXX 50 index options (ESTX50). And that's where I got lucky with timing :)

I sold a few weekly ICs on it at the end of February and rolled my previous ETF options into a May 3950/5000 Euro STOXX 50 PUT spread in early March, with the index trading just about 5400. The plan was to have an option spread about 10% OTM and roll it every few months, aiming to spend about 3% of my portfolio on the premium over the year.

I kept selling ICs along the way to recoup the cost of the initial spread until the Trump tariff thing happened. And it was something that I wanted to happen but wasn't really ready to handle. At some point, my spread was trading at 15-20X profit and still had a room to go up about twice from there if the index would keep going down.

So I forced myself to sit on my hands for a week, and when the TACO started to happen and the markets began to recover, I sold that spread for about 6X profit. There came another dilemma: should I succumb to FOMO and roll the spread to keep profiting if the markets keep doing down or sit on the cash for a while and see it through? I ultimately chose to keep gambling with the house money and entered a new Aug spread at some ridiculous IV with some erratic trades in between.

Although I managed to recoup most of that cost by entering short-term call spreads while the market was recovering, probably sitting on the cash for a week until IV becomes saner would have been a better choice in hindsight. You never know I guess.

I added another September spread to the mix and kept doing some more spreads. That all was pretty much vibe-trading without much pricing involved - I looked at the Greeks (mostly to keep my spreads delta-neutral) and the P&L profile, however didn't question whether the market prices make sense and didn't try to make any judgments on what do I think my P&L can turn out to be. I was happy with my profit despite not cashing out on the May spread at the best moment, however it felt that the luck component in my results is much bigger than the skill.

So I decided to pull the plug in the mid-May and stay away from trading for a couple of months until I get more structured. My current plan is to work on my own pricing tools for tail risk hedge: while it's impossible to predict the amount of profit in case of market crash, I want to focus on predicting the amount of money I'll lose on an option if the market keeps going up and the IV mean-reverts. The idea is to predict the carry cost in unfavorable market and then just harvest whatever I'll manage in the favorable one.

"S&P 500 hits 6000, my three options strategies for different market outlooks","The S&P 500 breaking 6000 is a significant psychological milestone. With renewed optimism from potential US-China diplomatic progress and strong economic data, we're at an interesting inflection point. Are we seeing the start of a sustained bull run, or is this setting up for a pullback?

I've been analyzing this setup using Tiger Options' P&L analysis tools and here are three strategies I'm considering:

**Bullish Play - SPY Bull Call Spread (June 27)** Buy SPY $610 Call / Sell SPY $620 Call

This defined-risk play targets moderate upside without explosive moves. Max loss equals premium paid, max gain equals $10 minus premium. Perfect for cautious bulls.

**Bearish Play - SPY Put Ratio Backspread (June 27)** Sell 1x SPY $590 Put / Buy 2x SPY $580 Puts

Asymmetric payoff that profits from significant downside moves. Max loss occurs around $580 strike, but unlimited profit potential below breakeven.

**Neutral Play - Iron Condor (June 27)** Sell $590 Put/Buy $580 Put + Sell $610 Call/Buy $620 Call

High-probability income strategy for sideways action. Collect premium as long as SPY stays between 590-610. Tiger Options' multi-leg order functionality makes executing these complex spreads much smoother.

Key considerations: Position sizing is crucial given current volatility. I'm monitoring 590 support and 610 resistance levels closely. The implied volatility screening feature has been helpful in identifying which strikes offer the best risk-adjusted premiums.
