$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.,"In no particular order:

- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.

- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.

- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.

- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.

- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.

- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango‚Äôs closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.

- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.

- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.

TSLA feels heavy  not your typical dip?,"TSLA dropped 5% today, almost 7% in two days. This doesn‚Äôt feel like the usual buy-the-dip setup

First, the subsidy threat is no longer just political noise. The Senate pushed forward a bill that could kill EV tax credits earlier than expected  that's about $1.2B off Tesla‚Äôs bottom line annually. Then Trump goes online and basically threatens to cut all federal funding across Musk‚Äôs businesses, including SpaceX

Second, demand in Europe looks weak. Sweden and Denmark just posted a sixth straight month of declining sales. Not great timing, since Q2 global deliveries come out tomorrow. Street is looking for an 11% YoY drop  if it‚Äôs worse, this thing probably flushes below $290

Also, I‚Äôm starting to think the ‚ÄúMusk distraction‚Äù angle is becoming more than just a meme. He‚Äôs on X talking politics, posting AI memes, calling out spending bills‚Ä¶ while deliveries are slipping. Doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence, and the market‚Äôs starting to reflect that

Not short yet, not buying either. Waiting to see the delivery number. If it disappoints, I may play short into 270s. If it surprises to the upside, maybe there‚Äôs a bounce near 285‚Äì290

Why I am buying TSLA even though it will be unprofitable without EV credits,"The Senate passed Trump's Big Beautiful Bill today, which will eliminate EV credits.

Although EV credits only accounted for 3% of Tesla's revenue last quarter, it would have lost about $186M without them.  And that's exactly why I'm buying TSLA.

Because for the first time in years, TSLA will trade like what it truly is: a money-losing, high growth AI/robotics/robotaxis startup hiding inside a legacy car company.

Even if it 10x - conservative if you understand the TAM of robotics and robotaxis - it would put Tesla above $10 trillion in market cap.  That's bigger than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple combined.

For that reason alone, I am long short-dated TSLA calls.",2025-07-01 13:46:35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lp9v7j/why_i_am_buying_tsla_even_though_it_will_be/,38,stocks,Why I am buying TSLA even though it will be unprofitable without EV credits,-0.2755,0.0,0.85,0.15

OpenAI‚Äôs Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>‚ÄúWe have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,‚Äù Altman said last week on the ‚ÄúUncapped With Jack Altman‚Äù podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, ‚ÄúIf our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that‚Äôs pretty cool.‚Äù

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI‚Äôs Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he‚Äôs building a direct competitor, xAI, that‚Äôs raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk‚Äôs vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in ‚Äúgeneralizable‚Äù A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI‚Äôs venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>‚ÄúI think he really gets it,‚Äù Altman said of President Trump‚Äôs approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) ‚ÄúI think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.‚Äù

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: ‚ÄúI have become a bit more, jaded isn‚Äôt the right word, but it‚Äôs something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.‚Äù

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: ‚ÄúDo you believe that, when you read those things?‚Äù

TSLA has been a terrible buy and hold,"From 1/4/2021 to 6/23/25 TSLA has gone up 43.34%

In the same time frame, MSFT (+123.25%), GOOGL (+91.39%), META (+159.74%), NFLX (139.75%), AAPL (+55.71%), S&P (+62.81%), and QQQ (+71.88%) have all outperformed. 

The only Mag 7 stock to not outperform TSLA has been AMZN (+30.84%).

What‚Äôs crazier still is that none of these numbers include dividends.

Also, as a side note: what‚Äôs even crazier still is that I looked at a forgotten about legacy company called General Electric. They are up a whopping 374.46% over the same time frame not including their dividend.

I would say the only redeeming quality of TSLA is that in this 4.5 year frame their PE ratio has dropped from ~1100 to 200. This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.

Also worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.

Lots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation. The only thing they can hope for now is to get EPS back growing positive instead of consistently negative Q/Q",2025-06-24 12:28:25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljhbcx/tsla_has_been_a_terrible_buy_and_hold/,62,stocks,TSLA has been a terrible buy and hold,-0.4767,0.0,0.659,0.341
"Tesla & Google heat up the Robotaxi race  TSLA pops, GOOGL lags","Big moves in the robotaxi world this week.

TSLA just launched its robotaxi service in Austin, TX over the weekend, and the market loved it. The stock ripped +8% on Monday and kept the momentum into Tuesday, pushing up another 2% premarket

Meanwhile, Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo (backed by $GOOGL) responded fast announcing its own robotaxi expansion into Atlanta through its Uber partnership. Waymo now runs in LA, Austin, Phoenix, SF, and soon Miami & DC. Solid coverage

What‚Äôs surprising though: $GOOGL only got a modest bump (\~1%) while $TSLA surged

Robotaxi = massive long-term play. Whoever wins autonomy could dominate transportation over the next decade

Personally, I‚Äôm a bit surprised by the muted reaction on GOOGL. Waymo‚Äôs rollout is arguably more polished  it‚Äôs already operating in multiple cities and has a real partnership with Uber. But the market still gives the hype crown to Tesla.

GOOGL, on the other hand, feels like it‚Äôs building the future‚Ä¶ quietly. Maybe too quietly

Still, I wouldn‚Äôt count Waymo out.

Tesla Robotaxi goes live  stock rockets TSLA will continue to rise   or is it going cold?,"Fellow TSLA observers, checking in  As you may have seen  Tesla made big news recently: self-driving cabs (Robotaxi) officially went live in Austin charging only $4.20 per order (yup  Musk is playing the game again) 

On June 23rd, Tesla launched a trial run of Robotaxi in Austin  Texas Pricing is $4.20 per order  and it still has a human safety officer sitting in the car  but it has already begun to pay for external operations News As soon as the news came out Tesla stock spiked 8-10% straight up in pre-market to close near $348-$350 for the day 

Is TSLA up or down?

So far: TSLA is still running high  shares around $349. 8%+ one-day spike after Robotaxi

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

News: [Us China Officials Say Consensus Reached On Geneva Framework](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/us-china-officials-say-consensus-reached-on-geneva-framework?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-More easing in Trump/Musk tensions, both have tweeted reconciliatory tweets earlier this morning and it seems their feud is at an end. Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.

[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.

My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16),"***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.

We all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.

This wasn‚Äôt a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.

On June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.

**Entry Zone:**  
$285‚Äì$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.

**Target Zone:**  
$305‚Äì$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.

**Danger Zone:**  
Avoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.

Now looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):

CRWV IPO‚Äôd in March and ran from \~$57 (May 13) to \~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That‚Äôs a classic parabolic extension.

It pulled back on June 5 to \~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.

Options flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150‚Äì$160, but we‚Äôre also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.

**Entry Zone:**  
Watching $130‚Äì$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.

**Target Zone:**  
$155‚Äì$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.

**Danger Zone:**  
A breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114‚Äì$118 as the next volume shelf.

**Conclusion:**  
TSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.

Would love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you‚Äôre tracking the same flows or setups.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.

[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.

We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.

Tesla stock falls again as Musk's 'KILL the BILL' screed hits Trump tax bill's progress,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html)

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk¬†posted on X¬†on Wednesday.

Musk¬†added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the¬†Wall Street Journal¬†reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week,¬†angrily¬†posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the¬†federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a¬†Congressional Budget Office estimation¬†of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing¬†some Tesla owners to become alienated¬†by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG,¬†GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating¬†250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",2025-06-05 08:01:00,1296,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l3yldf/tesla_stock_falls_again_as_musks_kill_the_bill/,193,stocks,Tesla stock falls again as Musk's 'KILL the BILL' screed hits Trump tax bill's progress,-0.5622,0.132,0.612,0.256

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp. The company said that guidance would have been $8B higher except for lost sales from the China restriction on H20 chips.

Yeah, Tesla‚Äôs talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they‚Äôre losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there‚Äôs BYD. Not as flashy, but they‚Äôre dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That‚Äôs game-changing

Sure, BYD isn‚Äôt as far along with FSD, but they‚Äôre investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock‚Äôs trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb‚Äôs model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1‚Äì2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla‚Äôs expansion into ride-hailing.

TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

That said, I'm not blind to the risks:

The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation,"

TL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.

---

I've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.

Current Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality

While Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:

Stagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline
Margin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume
Valuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation

The Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine

The Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:

* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques
* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)
* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)

Why $140-180 is Fair Value

A 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:

1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.

2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.

3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.

## Profiting From This View

Options for bulls(No not Caesars legion)  :
* Reduce position sizes to limit exposure
* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions
* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership

For bears (No not the NCR ):
* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility
* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward

For neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :
* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range
* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices

Risk Factors To My Thesis

I acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:

* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations
* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated
* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness
* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins

## Bottom Line

The market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.

At $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.

"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** ‚Äì Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that‚Äôs no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that‚Äôs valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** ‚Äì The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla‚Äôs next big thing, but it‚Äôs turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it‚Äôs starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** ‚Äì Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla‚Äôs self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla‚Äôs claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there‚Äôs a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** ‚Äì Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs alignment with Musk‚Äôs political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla‚Äôs market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they‚Äôre slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I‚Äôve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

What do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",2025-02-12 10:02:59,690,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1inu9y7/is_the_tesla_bubble_about_to_pop/,148,investing,Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"TSLA is contracting. Once 317 is breached, it will mark the next starting point of the trend.","The current monthly K-line pattern of TSLA is very interesting. It belongs to the typical type of high-level platform compression consolidation. 

After this wave retreated from the 488 high point, it repeatedly oscillated around the 317 level. Now it has contracted and narrowed for three months. This structure is very similar to ""accumulating force before explosion"". Once it breaks through, the direction will soon be clear. 

I made two plans: 

If 317 doesn't hold up, I will consider going short with swing strategy, looking at levels like 282 or even 248. 

If the price reverses and breaks down near 317, I will enter a mid-term call position, such as 340C or 360C, hoping for the platform to break through upwards. 

This structure generally does not recommend making sudden changes in direction in the middle. Unless a clear reversal pattern is observed on the daily or weekly charts. 

TSLA has always been an emotional stock, but now the trend seems more like an institution's move in hiding. The emotions are not as obvious as before.

TSLA puts potential for tomorrow,"Technical analysis 

After a bullish run last week with TSLA gaining over 10.5% gains, it looks to be either consolidating or potentially moving back down to lower levels of support.

After market close, Tesla broke below a significant demand zone at the $312 area. Either of 2 things could be happening with this post-market move.

 1. There is a liquidity grab getting ready to take place, that will push TSLA back into our most recent demand zone and push the stock back up further (to $318-320 area). 

OR

2. It will continue its down trend to another substantial demand zone (between $308-304 area).

I believe we can use this recent break to determine which direction Tesla will go tomorrow. If it break back into and the above the demand with a liquidity grab, calls could be the play. If it retests and rejects, or continues down further, puts could be the play.

What do you think will be the move?

"Zero-lag momentum indicator for options timing - NVDA, TSLA, SMR examples","Hi everyone!

I have been working on solving the age-old options problem: by the time a move is obvious, IV has already spiked. I built a zero-lag indicator that catches reversals as they happen.

Traditional indicators lag because they use moving averages. This reads momentum directly from price action - instant divergence detection. Unlike oscillators that just measure overbought/oversold, this reads the actual momentum flow within each candle.

  
Here are some examples: 

[TSLA weekly - \\""BE\\"" signal at $439, dropped to $222 \(-50&#37;\)](https://preview.redd.it/6mysklktnb7f1.png?width=2388&format=png&auto=webp&s=317e3c1fe3d96b6c0e8298c55581cda5d4fa1fc2)

More info in my bio.

  
Example: TSLA weekly hits $439, makes a higher high, but momentum shows lower high = bearish divergence. ""BE"" prints immediately. With MACD you'd wait weeks for confirmation. By then, puts cost 3x more.  
  
For NVDA at $95 - daily chart showed price made lower low, momentum made higher low = bullish divergence = instant ""BU"". Those $100 calls were dirt cheap.  
  
SMR weekly shows it works on small caps too - perfect for those high-risk/high-reward plays when you catch them early.  
  
Nothing works 100%, but the edge is catching reversals as they form, not after they're obvious. Daily for quick plays, weekly for swings that really pay.

BYD Defense Force

0.91 percent

BYD:0.47 percent

China's BYD ( BYDDY ) is having another stellar year, while its rival Tesla ( TSLA ) is getting bad news after bad news.

In April, BYD's pure electric vehicles (BEVs) surpassed Tesla's registrations in Europe for the first time.

According to research firm JATO Dynamics, Tesla registered 7,165 BEVs, while BYD edged out Tesla with 7,231 registrations. Crucially, Tesla's pure electric car sales in Europe plunged 49 percent in April, while BYD's sales soared 169 percent.

Registrations are used as a proxy for sales as Tesla does not publish monthly or regional sales figures. Despite the news, Tesla shares were up 2% in early trading.

Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in the report, ""While the difference in total monthly sales between the two brands may be small, the implications are huge. This is a watershed moment for the European automotive market, especially considering that Tesla has led the European all-electric vehicle market for years, while BYD doesn't officially operate outside of Norway and the Netherlands until the end of 2022.""

Tesla's recent woes in Europe are no industry secret.

1. **Wait for a pause candle** ‚Üí A narrow-range bar or inside day after the breakout (shows price is cooling)
2. **Assess the expansion** ‚Üí Did the move break cleanly? Is it holding above the coil range? Is the breakout at least 1x the size of the coil?
3. **Then ‚Äî sell premium using defined-risk vertical spreads**: Direction of breakout doesn't matter.

**Direction of breakout doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî here‚Äôs how I handle both:**

* üîº **If it breaks up:** Wait for pause ‚Üí Sell **call vertical spreads above** the move
* üîΩ **If it breaks down:** Wait for pause ‚Üí Sell **put vertical spreads below** the range

   * The highest open interest is really out toward those edges‚Äîputs at the low end, calls at the high end.
* Price-Pain Gap
   * That $16 difference suggests there might be a bit of downward ‚Äúpull‚Äù on TSLA today as market makers hedge.

**Why You Should Care:**

1. Price Magnetism
   * Market makers hedge to limit losses on sold options, and when expiry nears, they often push the stock toward the max pain level to minimize payouts.
   * Translation: we could see some selling pressure pushing TSLA closer to $270 today.
2. Sentiment Clues
   * Big put bets below $286 and call bets above it tell me folks are roughly neutral to slightly bearish on TSLA‚Äôs near-term moves.
3. Looking Back
   * If you check max pain for upcoming monthly expiries, today‚Äôs $270 is actually a bit lower than the future average, hinting today‚Äôs drag might be unique to this week.

**What To Watch & Possible Plays**

* Volatility Spike
   * Expect choppiness into the close as positions get unwound or hedged‚Äîespecially around $270.
* Hedge Consideration
   * If you‚Äôre long TSLA stock, a quick hedge (like buying a short-dated call or put) might make sense to offset today‚Äôs squeeze.
* Options Strategy
   * Holding a far-out-of-the-money option? Think about locking in profits (or cutting losses) sooner rather than waiting for last-hour liquidity to dry up.
* Pin Risk
   * Heavy strikes around $270‚Äì$275 can act like a magnet. Gamma exposure may ‚Äúpin‚Äù TSLA in that zone as traders jockey for position.
* After the Dust Settles
   * Once today‚Äôs options are toast, you could see a relief rally if the downward hedges unwind quickly.

**Bottom Line:** Max pain is a neat tool for spotting potential price currents, but it‚Äôs one puzzle piece. Always mix it in with your broader analysis‚Äîtechnicals, fundamentals, market news, etc.‚Äîbefore making a move.

Help me construct a calendar bear put spread on TSLA.,I‚Äôm thinking of putting on a calendar bear put spread on TSLA. My thinking is to go long OTM puts 4-6 weeks out with a delta of .30 while shorting OTM puts with 1-2 week expiration with a delta of .20. So I will be waiting of a bigger drop while I take out premium on the short leg. I would reload the short leg if the delta dropped to .10 rolling out a week to a .20 delta. Can you guys comment on this approach and what deltas and thetas you would initially target with this strategy?

Delta Neutral Position and Options Activity on TSLA,"I believe many people expect TSLA earnings will tank when reported today after market hours. From all the reports sales are significantly dropping worldwide, which means they can't sell emissions credits, the brand image is tarnished, people are not renewing leases, and even turning in cars, plus they're taking a write down on BTC (when marked to market). There's more, but that's enough to set the stage. Yet somehow the stock is green today.

What I think I see. There is an overload of Put buying activity. Market makers have to buy the stock to stay delta neutral. I'm guessing this is what is driving the price up. If earning come out as expected after hours, and the stock drops, I'd expect the stock to tank Wednesday. When traders close their Put positions, the market makers will react by selling shares to remain delta neutral, effectively putting more sell pressure on the stock, driving the price even lower.

Would love to hear people's thoughts.",2025-04-22 13:18:22,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1k5deba/delta_neutral_position_and_options_activity_on/,10,options,Delta Neutral Position and Options Activity on TSLA,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Tesla Calls on TSLL vs TSLA,"Assuming there's a sell off and the stock price slides after earnings call I would rather load up on TSLL calls vs call on the actual stock itself.

Yes there is more volatility in the TSLL but as an investor you are betting on Tesla being back at $250 or higher than the TSLL makes more sense.

Looking at the Sept 25 10's at $1.30.  Which seems to have the most movement.

Back up position is the Jan 26 9.43 at $2.01

\*\*Please reply with some insight to this particular trade- not just to bash Tesla's fundamentals as I'm aware of the risk/reward return.
